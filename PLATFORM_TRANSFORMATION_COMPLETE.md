## ðŸ“Š **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS UPDATE**

### **changes.md Implementation: 100% Complete** âœ…

All major components from `changes.md` are now implemented:

- âœ… **Deal-scoped collaboration** (invite lawyers/bankers to specific deals)
- âœ… **Inventory & allocation** (first-come-first-served with no oversell)
- âœ… **Document automation** (term sheet generation framework)
- âœ… **Fee accounting** (configurable fee plans and invoicing)

- âœ… **Introducer attribution** (commission tracking)

### **Key Acceptance Criteria Met** âœ…

From changes.md Section 10:

âœ… **Deal-scoped access**: Non-VERSO users (lawyers) can see only their deal's data  
âœ… **No oversell**: Atomic inventory operations prevent race conditions  
âœ… **Approvals gate**: Commitments require approval before allocation  
âœ… **Per-investor term sheets**: Fee plan selection drives custom documents  
âœ… **Fee calculations**: Configurable structures with proper accounting  
âœ… **Introducer attribution**: Commission tracking and payment workflows
