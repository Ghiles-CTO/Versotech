Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello. No, I cannot hear you. Maybe the microphone is deactivated. Hello. Hello. Okay, you can hear me but I cannot hear you. How should we do it? Is it the problem? Microphone problem. We can have a call in WhatsApp. If it helps. Oh.
Julien Machot: Okay, let me log off from here. Okay, can you hear me?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Great.
Julien Machot: Oh, okay. Better. Yeah, I was trying on my computer, but something's off. I'm not sure. I'm not sure why. Anyways, hey, thanks for meeting tonight. I hope you had a good weekend. um wanted to go through um the uh the demo and some of the the work you've progressed and uh see make certain like review together just to make sure that we're uh we're on track if that's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um so I was hoping to um use my laptop for the screen but I guess we're going to do it here.
 
 
00:05:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure.
Julien Machot: Uh it's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, you can also, I guess, enter with your laptop and deactivate the song and the microphone and so it doesn't you can see from them.
Julien Machot: It's a yes. Okay. Okay. Let me try. It's true. Let me try to do this. Okay. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It echoes. Hello Okay.
Julien Machot: Okay. Okay. That's the problem. Um, okay. No worries. Don't worry about it. Let's not waste time on this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: It's fine. I'll have to fix my computer at some point. I don't know what's going on. Uh, okay. No problem. Um, would you mind going to the to the demo? Uh, so we we can we can check it out. And I want to thank you first of all for um uh for the meeting we had uh with the team and stuff.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: It was really nice uh and I think we're on the right track as well uh in terms of how the platform looks.
 
 
00:07:03
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem.
Julien Machot: Um so um one very first thing um one very first thing I wanted to tackle with you is um our overall strategy.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure. Okay.
Julien Machot: So when we so we we agreed that we have a part uh for verse tech which is uh for the admin and the staff and me um so that's a specific login uh where we have certain options uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: the back office I mean we can monitor uh what's going on basically uh and that's fine and I will have like a super admin uh super power, super admin and then I'll have my employees and certain employees they'll
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: have limitations or restrictions in the system.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So yeah, Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, so there will be roles right assigned to the stuff people um and for each role there will be basic uh a schema of uh what they can do and what they cannot do and the super admin can do everything and has the page I think for super admin where they can manage stuff.
 
 
00:08:21
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: For example, they can remove employees and add employees, right? For example, uh other employees cannot do that. Right.
Julien Machot: Exactly. Superb. So this is very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um and then we have the client section and that part is uh our clients in Verso. Uh so this is the current uh business that we have where we um where we have certain investment fees and then we work with numerous clients who are going to uh join us uh and where we're going to do um some marketing and reaching out and building up databases. So these two are very clear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um and thank you the presentation I think was very efficient. And then we're going to have another part of the business which is to be able to uh have a like a platform offered to to other uh fund managers. So there they're the banks, investment funds, family offices, you know, all sorts of finance groups or entities.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: And what happens is they um have their systems either banking platforms like uh Timos for example or they have software from third parties.
 
 
00:09:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Some of them just commercial software. They subscribe online. Maybe it's in the cloud. Sometimes they run very old software.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this.
Julien Machot: So they're not up to date.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: And uh the majority they um their systems don't know how to welcome real estate and private equity. In other terms, if you invest in the stock market, that's okay. Their systems collect information from Bloomberg or from the market sources. Uh their screens updates information in real time with the prices in the market and all of this because it's all uh it's all available publicly. But as soon as you go into a private equity or a real estate or corporate finance deal, everything becomes very very complicated for them and they have a hard time subscribing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: So we will u most likely offer um a platform as well for these clients and these clients just like Verso they have a management team with officers and roles and they have also their own clients.
 
 
00:11:05
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So we will have like a SAS strategy together on this. Does this make sense as well for you? It's all fine.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that makes sense as well.
Julien Machot: Okay. Amazing. So now in terms of the portal, the first screen when we land, we are going to need to define uh how we um uh how we organize it, right? Uh for the clients. Um what do they see when they log in?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: And at the moment we have um a website which is versholdings uh.com.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: Um at the moment versholdings.com it's a website where uh we have just done very basic work. We don't even have accounts for users.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: This is an interface um nothing more than that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um one uh thing is Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I think uh you wanted me to add something like a login here where they click and they land inside the um investor platform portal and then they can create an account there and they can reach out
 
 
00:12:22
 
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to you via the portal. Is that what you wanted?
Julien Machot: Correct. That's that's what I thought and I wanted to to pick your brains on on this because uh do we do that or or or do we want to keep Verso Holdings as it is today? Just create a link so people can click on the link and it it goes into verse.com and then and then people go to verse uh and then Versotech is the software and the platform. Do you have any thoughts about this? How to organize it the best or it doesn't matter you think right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I think it depends whether you would allow everybody to uh enter inside uh the platform or not. for like the structure for now. There is permissions right for example um you can create an account but you are not as an investor when you create an account right someone from the staff portal have to create an investor account for you and assign
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it for you or there will be an onboarding part when you sign when you create an account um because as you told me right there they could be individuals it could be companies um as like an entity in that invest right it's not just one person so um there is all organized but when they create new uh account they are not an investor right right away right so they will have a couple of things but they
 
 
00:13:39
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: don't have holdings they can see deals um they can reach out to you via the messaging portal uh you have to create a conversation first with an investor like the way he set it up right now uh for
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: them uh to be able to send you messages um after you send them a message right um I can make it I can make it so that Everybody can create an account and everybody has access to the basic
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: features. I remember one of your team um members uh told me all right I think it is a good idea if we give the power to the investors to create and manage their own holdings as well like as an
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: investment page where they can there is like the holdings from virtual holdings and investment which could be uh the external things that they invest in so they can organize it and yeah and then I asked the question okay
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: do we make it as a separate platform or do we just integrate it with what we're currently building.
 
 
00:14:47
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think that um we need some thoughts on that.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So um do you think do you think there's any advantage to use the existing website because of its history because it's already there for several years because people know it or or do you think there's an advantage if
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: we use verse.com because then it the name is sort of technology related I mean is does it matter you think or not so much actually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh okay. So I understand. So for now um and do you see my screen right?
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So the way it's just naming for now right. So the way I named it um it is so when I go to the hosted version under the the link. So there is investor portal and stuff portal. the investor portal I named it versa holdings portal right so it's again you can see here it's vert holdings-lo right so which means uh let's say if you have it inside your website the versa holdings there is a
 
 
00:15:50
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: login button here when you click on it you go to versa holdings uh-.comLO so you lo you are logged into versa holdings it is branded as versa holdings verse tech um when it comes to verso tech it is
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the stuffaff portal right is the verse tech so when I go here you can see verse tech- login I mean it's just naming for now but how it's basically how we started it Yeah.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Okay, I I understand. Okay, so I guess for the time being we are going to decide to keep versholdings.com. We're going to keep this um as our portal as our name.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We will have on our website um which is managed under Wix at the moment. So, it's very basic and and you will see I have not done much.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Julien Machot: I just had um a designer do some work for me sometimes and also a lot of the content I did myself.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, it's very uh low low tech, but we'll have the um we'll we'll activate a way to uh for for people to create their accounts and then um everything we do is under versholdings.com.
 
 
00:16:56
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. Sure.
Julien Machot: Um we're going to keep verse tech as a uh legal name. Uh so for us there will be a company which will own the IP that will be called VersoTech.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: But for the clients this is Verso Holdings.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Nothing changed. Basically for the clients it's just adding technology.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure.
Julien Machot: So my clients they know they know us they know the website nothing has changed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We do it this way.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Exactly. So they will just add the button which includes um a little more right. So when you click on the button they can sign into uh the platform directly. I think that makes sense.
Julien Machot: And so yeah, and so if we have a versings dash uh login for example, that will bring people to wherever they need to login or dash uh dash uh uh tech
Ghiles Moussaoui: We discussed it also a little bit before. Okay. Yep.
 
 
00:18:01
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: uh for example. they can go to this this platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So here on this one um the clients see today they see their portal for them there is a staff portal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So actually um in the real uh in the real version uh the staff portal will not appear there because it will be yeah dedicated to the clients.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Of course. Yes. Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: Um yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, yeah. Sorry. This will not be uh visible. What would be visible is a landing page. It looks like this, right? for virtual holdings where you can create an account right sign up with Google or create an account and there could be a lot of text as well for example for uh let's say the branding or what it does and uh what you get inside etc and the button this one uh I think we can add it as a call to action not as a staff portal but as a platform to manage your own uh stuff right
 
 
00:19:00
 
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yep. Y could do we have um could we have simply an access that is versholdings.com-admin and then what happens is for the staff this is the page where they're going to land
Ghiles Moussaoui: so as an external platform the one we talked about Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: on their on their login and signins. Would would this work for you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, sorry, I didn't understand.
Julien Machot: Um, for the staff, uh, when they type on the browser, they're going to type versholdings.com-admin and then they'll go right away to the, uh, staff, uh, access, but but people but but people um, any visitor on the website
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uhhuh. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Julien Machot: will not see uh, uh, specifically, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Of course. Yep.
Julien Machot: uh and the clients they will just type uh dash login or they will click on the main page of the website versholdings.com and they will find the button that says um login or profile or whatever.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
 
 
00:20:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Um and then for the for the for the uh professional clients the banks the funds and uh the asset managers um do we do the same? Do we do we do we say versholdings.com um versholdings.com um uh dash um oh for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I think we could name them.
Julien Machot: the for the third party clients.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I think the idea of virtual tech is a good idea, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it's like a company um that is a software company that offers fintech for either let's say it is either the product that you use to manage everything which is stuff portal or the software for the third party
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: clients which is let's say verse yeah Okay, got it.
Julien Machot: Okay. So, I'm with you. So, basically for the third party clients, it will be verse.com and they will log in there. they will have their own uh their own uh login uh URL basically.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Totally interested.
 
 
00:21:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, yeah.
Julien Machot: That's beautiful.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should I get started?
Julien Machot: Uh yes, please.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. So, um All right. Let's start with the investor portal. Investor portal.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This looks like similarly as last time. Um so I have an account which is this this account I send you all credentials afterwards so I can sign in. I can also create an account.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um it demands though it I can just give my name and everything. It sends an email for verification and then I have an account.
Julien Machot: So, here on this page, I have uh nothing to say about uh it. The only thing I need to do, I need to send you the logo. um a verso uh the one that is um with the background is white and the letters are uh are basically uh dark. They're bold and dark.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Uh let me um I need to send you um Mhm.
 
 
00:22:34
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I can put it if it is something like this just bigger I can do it like you can see here this for example is not um to be like to stay to still stay here you know
Julien Machot: Correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can change it because just text it's the copy lighting yeah so I can change all of that as you can see I can just did Verso here and like Verso holdings here.
Julien Machot: It's just text. Correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, I can change all of that.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So, Verso logo. Let me just send you the logo. Um um because uh I have the logo black caps white background. Yeah. Okay, that's the one. Uh download. Um can I can I uh send it on WhatsApp? It's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, for sure. Yes, there's a picture.
Julien Machot: Yeah. So this is the the the the official logo is just the letters. They are in bold.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Great.
 
 
00:23:34
 
Julien Machot: Uh there are league league spartan league Spartan font.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um okay and they have a space in between the letters. So this is the versal logo and I think on LinkedIn and everywhere else you'll see this. I'm going to give you also um um some some other logos with the with the colors because sometimes we do variations.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um so for example we have uh the one with a blue that is very well known by the clients as well. So just to give a variation um these are the two most used logos that we have and you see there are also the corporate colors basically white uh light blue and black.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Sure. Okay. Great. Um, yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Julien Machot: Okay. Excellent. That's that's it. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. So, yeah. So, here it's um the way we saw it last time. So, there is the KPIs and everything, right?
 
 
00:24:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, it's kind of a dashboard. I think I would need to change it.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um because as you told me last time, the KPIs u are not the exact thing that we need. And so um when you have time you can send me the KPIs or we can let it until we finish all of the pages everything works correctly and then we create a dashboard out of it because I believe
Julien Machot: Right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you have to finish the pages and then the dashboard will be the last thing because you will wrap up everything together.
Julien Machot: Yeah. So on this is is this the part for the clients? It is right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: Okay. So um the platform fulfills uh a few functions. uh one it allows access to the deals marketing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So that's one marketing we are presenting deals. So in this dashboard when people will come the very top will be the new deals um that they see right away with one click uh they can uh deep dive into the deals.
 
 
00:25:38
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So we will put like a nice photo, we will put the logo of a company uh like for example OpenAI, we'll put the logo of OpenAI.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So it's an eye catcher.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
Julien Machot: Yeah. More like a design rather than a database type thing like a and then um so that's the first thing. It's marketing the deals. Um number two um it's the actions uh required.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So um basically like an action center. So you'll have the the deal center uh first then you're going to have the action center and action center will be um the robots or the the the agents will be um working controlling what the account is doing. Uh if a person um needs to do a compliance update, there will be a popup and that's will be a way where um notifications if you prefer comes up and the person who comes into his or her account
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: they need to click and act they need to do something that's going to help us maintain uh the system.
 
 
00:26:55
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, sir.
Julien Machot: Okay. Um there is uh so these two things are uh the first two things and the last one uh apart from actions required and from marketing the deals it's the reporting and monitoring reporting and monitoring so um yeah so
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Okay. Wait. Okay.
Julien Machot: um so I think the bottom part with some performance and all of this uh is useful and will kept but the top part will be really about the actions. New deals, new marketing and actions.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So these for example right what is in here net value assets and all of that it is about the deals you can see all deals portfolio overall so revolute signary AI and everything right the holdings are here right
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for this investor specifically there is three holdings right but there is a couple of deals that you can see here and this is basically KPIs around the deals right and they allow you to take a decision or something
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay. So, so one thing one thing that's going to be important about the KPIs you showed me at the top.
 
 
00:28:07
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: like Yeah.
Julien Machot: So these KPIs I think we will need them but we will need them uh related only to the deals that the client has invested in right not like a general statistics about everything because the client is not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, the whole things Yeah.
Julien Machot: supposed to know uh you know if the client did not invest in uh 20 deals he he picked only two the client's going to see only two that's Yeah, the holdings only.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, of course I understood. So the holdings only were all understood.
Julien Machot: And I think that statistical part instead of putting it in the dashboard, maybe we can move it down to uh um either the reports or holdings.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: It's up to you. But we need to move it, I think, to another section on the left. uh uh holdings or uh uh reports uh probably holdings I think uh on the left side.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Okay. For the holdings. Okay. Like uh here we can do many things, right?
 
 
00:29:21
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So what I thought about the dashboard is where you can see data about your own holdings. So what do you have actually right? I could add an overview page.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: An overview page will be focused on more marketing and also services notification and everything so that the dashboard focuses on all right what the customer has right so that it um um this is just my opinion so that
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it does not seem like over overly marketed only all right the dashboard the name is all right to data about the activity of the investor and in the overview have um overview will be the first page. It wouldn't be a dashboard. It will be the overview. And so yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay. So, here's there's a I I agree with you. Uh that's what you would expect. Uh but I think we're going to use it a little bit differently.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: when when I log in to my account, the first thing I'm interested in seeing is, oh, what are the new deals?
 
 
00:30:31
 
Julien Machot: What is exciting today?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Uh, checking your performance or checking your uh past investments. It's more like a controlling thing. That's not exciting for most people.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: It's actually annoying, right? So I I think the philosophy is the dashboard will show people fun exciting new stuff the marketing but also the actions take action for example if we invite the clients for a dinner the invite will pop up there
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. Okay.
Julien Machot: um if we want to do like I I'm I um if I send an a message inside the system to the client I want to invite the client personally.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: That's where it's going to show.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And what you said earlier about the overview of the investments, the performance, the KPIs, yes, we need it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: But I want you to move it to uh more like the holdings or reporting. It's up to you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I also have it in the holdings.
 
 
00:31:39
 
Julien Machot: Uh that's where people will click.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, if I go for example to holdings right now, you can see a couple of KPIs. There is not much uh no charts or anything but you can see uh so there is like three holdings. This specific um investor has three holdings and there was a couple of KPIs.
Julien Machot: Exactly. Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I could add a couple charts here that could apply and they would remove it from Yeah.
Julien Machot: Exactly. Perfect. Yeah. But when when when the client says, "Okay, I have a concern. I'm worried." He's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: going to go onto his account right away. He's not even going to look at the dashboard right away.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: He will go into the uh holdings uh right away.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: He will check there and then once he's done checking, he's going to go to the reports because he will probably want to extract uh because maybe he says, you know, I'm going to send it to my banker.
 
 
00:32:32
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I'm going to send it to my lawyer. So yes, that's why.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. Uh okay. And this is basically the active deals page.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um the active deals page when some so let's say an investor has an account they will see nothing here right in the first part.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The reason is you have to allocate a specific deal to a specific investor for them to be able to see it. And my reasoning behind that is that later down the line I think we could add the recommendation system that connects to the database and also the like in let's say the data of specific investors that could create dynamically
Julien Machot: Oh, yeah. That's good. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh deals for investors right so based on the deals that you have let's say you want to create and the investor what they have um let's say historically invested in also let's say if they allow us to use
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the data that they have about their other investments, right?
 
 
00:33:34
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, if we allow them to monitor their other investments here, then the deals will be more like a recommendation system.
Julien Machot: Yep. Yep. So this is a very important point.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: You just uh talked about the recommendation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: Um what we need each uh user account holder to do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We need them as soon as the the account will be launched, we need them to answer like uh 10 questions about their uh risk uh aversion or appetite, the types of investments they like, the sorts of sectors they
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: like, the sort of money they want to invest. So we will have like um in inside of their uh settings there should be some options for the investment uh strategy or investment profile because you're right then the s either the system or the agents
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Yeah.
Julien Machot: or myself personally by clicking and choosing the people and matching with the deals we will be able to send invitation And this is basically what I do every day on my WhatsApp.
 
 
00:34:54
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: On WhatsApp, I just forward a text that I prepared about uh SpaceX and I send it to 10 people.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And you know what?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Every time I send that one message on WhatsApp, out of maybe 10 people, I have three people who say, "Oh, send me more. I'm interested." Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: and then I follow up by email and I send the documents and the NDA and all that. Here in the system, we want the investors in their accounts to give us more information about what they like uh what sort of investments and we should have an agent at term who's going to make sure to qualify
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: all of the accounts we have. qualify uh continue to engage with the people, continue to ask them questions.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Sure.
Julien Machot: Oh, oh, did you see the news about SpaceX last week? What do you think?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, yeah, that will become very smart this way.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
 
 
00:35:57
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Um and like the logic we discussed last time as well. So when they submit the commitment, it will create an approval uh notification inside the stuff portal which allow you to approve.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The moment it approves it is uh it issues a task for them and the task is basically to sign a contract an agreement or an NDA based on the deal and once it is signed they will have access
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to the dealer room and then they can take a decision from there.
Julien Machot: So the tasks you have here on the left column, I think some of these tasks you will see also on the dashboard as soon as you arrive.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yep. Yep.
Julien Machot: uh there will be like actions uh that we want them to to take and the idea is that really people get onto their account immediately.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: They see what we're up to. They see invitations.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:36:55
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Uh they see that there's a deal closing uh next week. They really have to get in touch with me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: um it should become our engine for uh producing revenue and closing deals. So that's why the dashboard will be key uh will be very very important for us.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, for sure.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And uh yeah, this is basically how it works. This is the deals. Um the information, a couple of info.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. So, this is the deals. There will be documents, but I think I will change the logic. I will create another page which is deal room, right? that links to specific deals and opens the the the documents for like the ones that already signed the agreement in the NDA.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um, so let me show you on the active deals when you go down a little bit on the Revolute. Uh, okay.
 
 
00:37:48
 
Julien Machot: Here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay. So, um, okay, I get it. Uh okay. So the green box minimum investment not a problem. The unit price uh on the right not a problem. Target amount and then we say the amount raised. I don't want to uh I don't want to show uh uh the clients the specifics of the progress because I I'll tell you why.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay. So, u this is not exactly like a crowdfunding uh platform. A crowdfunding they give you always the progress bar.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, you see how many people came in, they write a check of 100 bucks, blah blah blah blah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: In our job, you know, it's very different. In our job, we uh let's say I negotiate uh 50 million with SpaceX. SpaceX, they contract us at Verso, but sometimes I have a client for, let's say, 10 million, they're going to want to go direct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: And so, technically, I have 50, but I'm giving 10 away directly, and I'm keeping 40. So, then if we try to say there's a progress bar, it's going to be too complicated.
 
 
00:39:09
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: It's going to be too messy uh because it doesn't make sense anymore.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, what I would say is just put an amount. So, we'll put the amount. No need for a progress bar.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: Um, so we say up to 50 million.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Oh, and by the way, um, often because I'm very careful in my in my business, often I say up to the amount.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I I rarely say 10 million because um, actually, you know what happens? Uh, the more money I bring, the more sometimes I can get. So, it's a bit strange.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, sometimes I'm going to say, "Okay, uh, SpaceX, I want 30 million." But sometime I have 50. So, it's it's always a moving target.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: But what makes the difference is the timing is the clock.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, they say, "Oh, Julian, tomorrow you have to wire 30 million. Are you ready?" Yes
 
 
00:40:09
 
Julien Machot: or no? If I'm not ready, maybe I lose the deal, you know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, of course.
Julien Machot: Um, so yes. So it will be up to an amount and that will be reflected in the term sheet as well um for each each opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh and the term sheets will be inside the deal rooms or directly here.
Julien Machot: So uh that's a good question for the clients when they come here they see MedTech solutions they see a highlevel description. Um we will include the website we will include maybe the website.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, when you click when you click on view more details, you can get like a couple of more details like the overview, inventory, free structure, and activity my activity which is like if do I do I have
Julien Machot: Um, yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: any activity on this or no the overview is basically the meta data inventory how much do we still have let's say available reserved allocated fee structure um fee structure is basically yeah um Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yes. Okay. Our feet will add up.
 
 
00:41:20
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. I think I think um okay. So, uh, when they come and see those deals, um, um, sorry, R, where did you click to open this uh, page?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: This uh, oh, there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: View details.
Julien Machot: Okay. Sorry, I couldn't see. Oh, view details. Okay, I see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think there should be a certain amount of details that they can see to take a decision to sign the NDA and then a lot more details and say once the sign once they the NDA is signed and
Julien Machot: I see. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: they have access to the deal room. Um yeah.
Julien Machot: Yes. So that's true. So once they sign the NDA, they will have access to an entire deal room with lots and lots of documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So I'm not worried so much after here at this stage where we at now when they click on the so basically here we need an action button um to to say um uh to say um explore or
 
 
00:42:17
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: I'm interested um something like that explore maybe I am interested we we need uh we need something there um an action button. So the the client will be um it's a call to action um Revolute.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, yeah.
Julien Machot: So let me see Revolute overview inventory fee structure. Yeah, I see. Okay, I see the investment vehicle is there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the default key structure if it is a default thing.
Julien Machot: Feast everything is done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um you remember the term sheets you sent me term sheets and subscription packs and everything I still have to implement that correctly.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I'm working on it right now. This is the version that is inside the cloud, right?
Julien Machot: Oh, okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The cloud it means uh I have multiple version of the platform, right?
Julien Machot: Okay. Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Because I have to test everything, make sure everything works correctly locally and then I deploy it and then I can test it inside uh the cloud.
 
 
00:43:34
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. Fantastic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay. Yeah, I think just action buttons here to because um what we have right now, we have clean information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: It's well organized, but what we don't really have is the call the call to action so that we can um successfully lock in the client, right? Um it's how how are we going to do that?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, I get it. Yeah. So, yeah.
Julien Machot: How do we um you know because they can read, they can click but but but we need to bring them to saying okay I'm in I want to do it. You know what I mean?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, totally I understand. So there is uh also this for example for the revolute right once it is closed so the the deal is no longer valid.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can see here deal closed no longer accepting right um here.
Julien Machot: Uh yes. So here we have no longer accepting because this particular deal uh it was closed.
 
 
00:44:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uhhuh. Yeah.
Julien Machot: However, uh we will know that the user was clicking on it. And so what we should have is a button that says notify me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I'm interested. Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah, I'm interested. So notify me for the next deal because we don't want to lose that interest.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: Oh, it actually makes me think we will need to we will need to follow up and monitor the clicks that they do on the deals because then we can have an agent who's going to send a notification to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: the client after he clicked and reviewed uh some of the terms.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: And maybe there the agent will say um will say uh are you interested in Revolute? Please let us know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Next step would be this this this this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Good know. Exactly. So I think it would be also helpful to track um track the user like what they are interested in and have like some kind of a profiling uh of each investor will help you understand also and serve them
 
 
00:45:39
 
Julien Machot: Perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: best.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay, that's fantastic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah, you see uh my focus for these parts, the dashboard and the active deal is clearly how to market it, make it easy, make it attractive.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: This is the marketing. How do we get the client to click, read enough to feel good about it, and act?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: They have to act. Everything you do here is execution.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. Yes. So what I was thinking uh when I was how I was thinking about the marketing is that um like my business knowledge so far I think for when it comes to small offers um let's say things that you can sell for a subscription thing um to up to let's say 500 a month marketing applies a lot so things like urgency scarcity for example there is not enough shares left in in everything um then it applies to
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that situation but I think the more money there is let's say if there is investment uh in revolute or something I think they have to spend way more time thinking about it right so uh yeah
 
 
00:47:01
 
Julien Machot: Mhm. You you are right. But you remember there's also the problem that we um we live in a world that's become really crazy and now uh you know a company like Revolute they give us a schedule and there's not enough time. You know what I mean? Like for example we will put a deadline. You know we will say actually that's that's actually an important box is to say not only target amount minimum investment unit price maybe we can say indicative uh uh completion date and and for example um this is a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Julien Machot: real story because it's happening now. Uh Revolute they wanted us to so they they gave us the allocation for $10 million. This is real.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: It's happening now. $10 million on the new round of 76.2 billion.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Uh Verso is invited again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: And they said um you are in. Congratulations. They said this on October 6. And then they said by October 9, you need to sign everything, which is crazy.
 
 
00:48:06
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Julien Machot: 3 days. So we had to review all the documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I had to stress my clients. I had to move everybody quick quick quick quick quick quick because we had only 3 days. I worked late at night.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I was working with my client in Singapore early morning the next day. It's a lot of stress.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So actually uh you're right uh usually about this but we are working on a clock and so my investors um they will see Revolute is available the clock is ticking the clock is ticking and then u you know
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: and and then the system the agents me my team we will organize the work around the timing. So we will have agents that will be smart because the agents will see the clock. They will know what's the deadline. They will follow up on the prospects and tell them look you really need to uh review the data room.
 
 
00:49:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh some agents they will follow up on Q&As.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Some agents they will follow up on documentation that's missing maybe for compliance purposes. And all of this it's a dance. It gets people to start dancing with us and then at the end some people always some people fall through some people don't make it on time but that's a lot of stress but it's it's execution you know if
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Julien Machot: I don't if I don't follow up on each and every document each and every person I wouldn't be successful the platform would fall in disarray so this is how we got to be very good here in platform is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: that it's going to accompany the the the the investor step by step. It's going to help them. It's going to follow up on them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Okay. I understood. Yes. Um I think um the smart um some like an agentic super um sorry a super agent right that connects to every part of the data and it is scheduled so that it understands um let's say the core principles
 
 
00:50:17
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: of the business which is all right for example if there is a deal deal um has a timeline right and so for example for the investors that uh try to get access to the deal room.
Julien Machot: Okay. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: They need to sign or allocate some chair before everything is done.
Julien Machot: VBA. Yeah, that that's correct. Exactly. Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: So here we need um the action button.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Once they click on Revolute and they like it, they want to proceed. Uh where can they click for um to to uh to say that they they are interested?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah, I will add the button here I guess at the end.
Julien Machot: Somewhere here. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Or something directly.
Julien Machot: There should be several places several places where they can click uh so it's easy to find.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yep.
Julien Machot: Um and then uh so that's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.
 
 
00:51:22
 
Julien Machot: So that's great. Um no, I think the colors are fine.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Uh, also a question for the colors. Do you want me to minimize everything and make everything um blue and white or the colors are fine?
Julien Machot: And for the only thing I'll say is the company logos will be the real logo.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: So for example, OpenAI, we go and find the logo of OpenAI.
Ghiles Moussaoui: For sure.
Julien Machot: That's the only difference.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. So, uh also the website for example if you want to include the website of the company or stuff like that.
Julien Machot: Oh yes. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I think we should and it should be a new window that opens so that the investor doesn't get away from our website.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, totally. And I think um this will also all be done I will show you right now in the stuff portal. It will be done from the stuff portal where they can you know put an image for an icon for each deal and everything.
 
 
00:52:22
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And um one thing I wanted to tell is that I added the the like the possibility to create deals without holdings, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So without specific vehicles, I mean for example, right?
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Revolute is um like the the investment vehicle let's say is Versaf fund, right?
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But if you go here, this one has no investment vehicle. So you can create deals that don't have an investment vehicle.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let's say the the the type is different. Uh maybe it's real estate, something else.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah, that's basically it.
Julien Machot: Mhm. And can I link it to a vehicle later?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. That that is all done inside the stuff portal.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, okay.
Julien Machot: Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Documents. Documents. What I've done right now is that I have folders. When I click on first documents, I get into folders and um based on the investment um I have let's say I have three V three or four holdings right and then I click on holdings and I have specific
 
 
00:53:30
 
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: subfolders let's say the agreements KYC documents NDA position statements reports and everything and I click on them I have the data right for now I don't have documents in it and they also have other docs uh other docs
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: which are unrelated to the specific um investments, right?
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And I also structured them by category which means uh you can go by category which means instead of having a high level um by folder by um vehicle you would have directly categories right. For example, agreements documents you have here KC position statements.
Julien Machot: Good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let's say you have a couple and they are also uh structured by the investment um that you have in real estate have these position statements.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um SVP delta you have these and all so on this what I've done so far here.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Um are these this section is it the same as the data room for the deals or is it different?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh no I think it would be different because uh this will be mostly orchestrated uh towards all right what you already invested in right so stuff that you have um access uh to forever right um because when I
 
 
00:54:38
 
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: when we will do the agent thing the agents will be able to create the data here right it will be for example an investment um uh sorry position statements and also So, uh, reports, right? But you don't want the, um, like the AI to in the first time, let's say, do changes to, uh, the deal rooms, right?
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Data rooms.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah, that's true.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, I think I would prefer to add another page for that, which I will do later on. Okay. Should I move forward?
Julien Machot: Um I think we need to we need to define exactly um which documents will end up here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um probably I think mostly there will be the legal documents for the investor who just decided to sign um is coming into a new investment. He will sign a contract. It will be here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Maybe the copy of the NDAs for each deal will be there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:56:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um the reports are not going to be here because the reports will be in the other section, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: The deal um the deal room is that Uh, where do you want it to be?
Julien Machot: Um no no the investment reports with the performance it will be somewhere else right in under reports on the left column.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. This categories.
Julien Machot: No, no, sorry. If you go to the left, uh, left left there's reports.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Okay. So, what you need to do maybe is see if, um, uh, wait, let me let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um, okay. So, I think that the section called documents and the section called reports, you're going to merge them somehow.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um, I I I I think that under reports, the client will find all the relevant legal documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: He will find the position statements, the quarterly reports, the monthly reports, yearly reports. Yes. Yes. Yes.
 
 
00:57:27
 
Julien Machot: But he will find the other documents. So for example, you will find administrative communications, tax updates, uh anything that's related to compliance is going to be in not there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So all documents you think okay yeah I will do that um I could name it reports and docs documents because here you can also have requests, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah. All all of this will move to reports to simplify the menu as well. Yeah. Yeah. No, just just leave it. I think you don't need to bother. just leave it to reports and then people will know everything uh that's signed and already invested will be there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Sure thing. All right. Yeah. And uh once so because we jumped to reports. So in the reports um I have I can generate position statements.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is not done very well right now.
Julien Machot: Correct. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I would prefer to um have it a better in a better way because I think no like you don't want um investors for example to generate position statements whenever they want right you could for example make this only
 
 
00:58:23
 
Julien Machot: Yes. Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: available or only scheduled right which means they know it's available and it will work but they cannot generate it every time let's say it's a monthly basis quarterly thing is that correct Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, correct. Yep, that's Yeah, that's correct, actually. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, Mhm. when I create on generate.
Julien Machot: So, this is clear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, this is clear that this section this section I have no problem with.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And then it's Yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh absolutely fine. Um um I have a question for you. Um if I look at the left column again at the titles that we have, let me look at the titles. We have dashboard. We have um active deals.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yep.
Julien Machot: Uh holdings would be what they invested in. So holdings would be uh the portfolio. You can call it portfolio instead of holdings.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Got it. Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
 
 
00:59:40
 
Julien Machot: Um the documents button here will disappear. We'll merge it with reports.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Mhm.
Julien Machot: Um then under report uh we can change the order. I think that below reports you will have the section with tasks and messages. Um where um yeah tasks will be listing uh a number of things they have to do and we're communicating to them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: messages will be like our little internal internal WhatsApp basically. Okay, perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: That's very good. Yeah. So, we're getting rid of documents and we're merging it with reports just to make it more more more sleek. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Understood. And uh there is this small custom uh request thing. Let's say if the process or like they want something very custom, they can write it here and it will be shown inside stuff.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And the messages.
Julien Machot: Perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the messages for now I um I added a way to write messages but the conversation or the group can only be started from the stuff portal, right?
 
 
01:00:53
 
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And once I started there then the investor can see it here.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And for example, this one is a group I added.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, it was a group that No, I deleted. I think it was deleted. One participant.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, you can see Julian is here and Yeah. And you can basically send messages. Um, yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay, very good. So, um here in this messages, this is a this is a general message. It's not related to the compliance or the due diligence on an investment, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh no.
Julien Machot: This is not it's it's just general messaging.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So I can add like um a structure where for example you could start a conversation based on a specific deal or a specific uh portfol let's say holding.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you think?
Julien Machot: So if if a client clicks on Revolute and the client um uh sign the NDA, he enters a data room.
 
 
01:02:07
 
Julien Machot: He's going to have access to a lot of information that's very confidential.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: there at that point he's going to have questions. So, uh he will be able to do Q&As's like questions and answer and write to us messages without using WhatsApp.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Um um would we have a similar message box within the due diligence part?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think yeah I think they can like click on a crypto action which is start a conversation with uh about this um let's say deal right and that could be it um basically it will start a conversation it
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: would maybe add group or send it to let's say the super admin and also maybe other people with specific roles that you want, right?
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I think yeah, I think that could be the thing. Um I had like the there's also an idea where you could add um like an agent, right, that connects there with like a chatbot.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: They can chat with it regarding information that they need.
 
 
01:03:17
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: But I think it will still not be as good as talking to somebody because if you're trying to close a deal, it's like sales when it comes to the deal room and then you'd like to talk to someone. Uh what do you think?
Julien Machot: Yeah. I I agree with you actually. I think there will be an agent for each and every deal that the client clicks on and says I'm interested.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I sign an NDA. So the NDA agent is activated. They enter the data room. Then you have an agent for data room and due diligence that's activated. The client may ask questions that the agent will be able to answer partly, but the agent will also be able to follow up on the client, what do you need? Do you want to talk to our team? And then the team gets notified. So, okay, that's how we're going to do it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, great.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay, understood.
Julien Machot: Okay.
 
 
01:04:14
 
Julien Machot: Fantastic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So that's uh this is basically so far the um investor portal. So let's go to the vers the stuff portal.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you told me last time um use another color plate. So I changed it to a black background.
Julien Machot: Yes, that's very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will this account later. You can test it with it. So yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is basically look.
Julien Machot: Oh, yeah. This is definitely the uh staff um version, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So again, yeah,
Julien Machot: So, maybe at the at the very top uh where we see uh return Verso Tech, we're going to add up something like uh staff uh staff platform uh keep keep confidential and private at all time or keep confident confidential at all times. We need to add some some red in red maybe language.
Ghiles Moussaoui: sure.
Julien Machot: Okay, fantastic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure thing. And this uh for now um like the first dashboard is just you know something I started uh you have for example workflow runs compliance rate uh pending KYC maybe active um LPC's operation and everything.
 
 
01:05:35
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. So this is this is basically the place. This is very interesting. This is the place where you have an overview of every single entity or SPV we use uh for the investments to be uh put together.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: It's also the place where we monitor all the accounts, all the compliance, all the documents of each one of our clients and each one of the deals. So there is uh the entities the sourcing of the deals with other parties the clients themselves with their entities.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So this is where we're going to monitor everything. This is where my team and I we have headaches every day.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you want me to do you want me to put it as a table uh kind of view with everything?
Julien Machot: That's exactly the place. Yeah. Um I guess uh I I'm afraid it will be uh if you put it will be very scary.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Because I think the um Yeah. Like the idea is to make it as smooth as possible, right?
 
 
01:07:01
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is a page for every type of um you know activity. For examps, approval, deals management, entity management, investor management, process management, request management and etc. Um, and so yeah, I think they could be all linked to this um, dashboard, but I think if you every
Julien Machot: Yeah, I think I'm better. Yes. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: clunky a little bit in the dashboard, I don't know.
Julien Machot: I I I think I think the fact that um Okay, so here's what we need to do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, me.
Julien Machot: I think uh you remember the um the Excel uh list of all the vehicles I sent you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: Um I think I think we need to try to use it um to test um the ergonomy of of the dashboards.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: Uh because if I go on the left side on the left column and I click on entities is it true I will see all the entities of Verso.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So you will see all of them as like a table kind of view like as you can see.
 
 
01:08:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I can create multiple views of course.
Julien Machot: Correct. So we will need to uh load uh the Excel spreadsheet I gave you. We'll need to load all the everything all the database.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: We will have all the vehicles and um you and I will need to do a separate call, separate session where we we try to click and see how it looks and um um and see see how we can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. I will do. Yeah, sure.
Julien Machot: optimize. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Of course. Yes. Um, yeah, I had an idea also regarding that. Um, do you want me to add like multiple type of views or would it just be clunky? Because as a cannabon for example um so in a grouped let's say in a grouped way where um the status for example um is let's say from to-do uh for tasks for example right you have to do in progress and done and you have so everything grouped um in one column here and the others here and the others here so it's a canon
 
 
01:09:16
 
Julien Machot: Yeah, honestly any any type of uh uh regroup or filter that you can apply to help uh uh each one of my team members adapt the way they like. It's it's helpful. It's helpful because this is like a a tool u where some of my colleagues they spend uh eight hours a day on it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So we're going to try to make it as nice as possible.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, got it. Yeah. Yeah. For now, there is a search thing.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, you can search Right. Uh you can group uh fund or something specific securities and all all currencies group by currencies.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But yeah know that's basically it.
Julien Machot: There's there's one thing I think we need to have um um before the name itself you can have the um the ref uh and the ref can be you remember we use uh VC2 VC106 um yeah so we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Sure he is. first.
Julien Machot: will simplify um so when we type in the set search bar we can type VC40 and then we find it very quickly.
 
 
01:10:25
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, correct.
Julien Machot: Hey.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah, I understand. And there is um the other thing is that so you can edit the normal metadata which is shown here, right? And there is specific page for each entity.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: When you click on view, you see it.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So for universal found two there isn't much data here this maybe yeah so for example there's formation date registration uh active directors and everything so you have an overview thing you have the documents that are
Julien Machot: very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: related to it you can upload the documents as Oh,
Julien Machot: Uh so entity documents uh very good entity documents we will put all the KYC for each entity and uh there uh you have a button that says upload entity documents. You need to have also download uh the whole pack in one zip folder or you can click the documents you want and you can download in one zip the ones that you need.
Ghiles Moussaoui: got it. Yeah. Okay.
 
 
01:11:43
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think um it will be a little bit more complex for example like this is my first try implementation, right? Because I think I should add folders here as well, right? To group them for example by KYC or um something else, reports for example or deals, right?
Julien Machot: Uh yes, you can have uh you can have um let me think you can have uh KY KYC.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So okay so maybe we can create a folder and we can name the folder KYC or we can name the folder legal documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Sometimes also we have the uh redemption like closing when we shut down the vehicle because some of our vehicles they stay alive for 5 years, 7 years, 10 years and then after this period of life they they shut
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: down. We give the money back we we we we have performance.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Y yes.
Julien Machot: So for example last week I paid 4 million to an investor. The investor had come uh 3 years ago for 1.5 million.
 
 
01:12:52
 
Julien Machot: So now we redeemed the investor. So the entity is shut and inside the investor is shut as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, no problem. I will add the feature that allows that.
Julien Machot: Okay. Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, this is documents. There is direct directors as well. Um, yeah. So, for directors, what do you think um we should do? Should we be able like for example to add people from the staff member or to add external or invite for example lawyers to it?
Julien Machot: Um, so this is very good. Um, yeah, I think we could have um directors. Um you could have um um you could have uh you could have the shareholder shareholders which is often the group versus group but in some cases we do joint ventures or partnerships.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: You will have lawyers, you will have accountants, and you'll have um you will have uh administrators and you will have auditors.
 
 
01:14:09
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, got it.
Julien Machot: Uh you know, you can put one more, you can put uh uh strategic partners. So there my team will just fill up uh the information um as we start new vehicles.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, no problem. Okay. So, this director's uh deals. So, if for example vers one has deals, then they would be listed here. But for now, I think this one does not have Yeah.
Julien Machot: Correct. And uh there maybe you can have a button. Um uh so this is verso fund one. So this is one specific vehicle. So somewhere there uh we need to have um another sorry to bother you again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: We need to have an action center because when my team go and drill down into versal fund one, there will be a number of things that are not done yet, the system will flag.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So for example, if we're missing certain documents, there should be here pop-ups like that are required.
 
 
01:15:33
 
Julien Machot: and my team, I'll have someone in my team whose job is to make sure that every vehicle is in the green, that there's no red flag, only green.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, this could be for example.
Julien Machot: And maybe um maybe you and I can have a system of points like a system of um of uh thumbs up green and thumbs down red to show uh you know like green flag red flag or green flag
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yep.
Julien Machot: red flags up to you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, I thought uh like we could do for example um entity status where you have all right of what is correctly uh what is there what is not there you know what is there in green what is not
Julien Machot: Yeah, exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: there in red and you basically can take care of what is Okay.
Julien Machot: Exactly. Exactly. Absolutely. That that's that's good. And um um I think this is very good because um at at the super admin level if I want to check in the future, if I want to check in one click all my entities, all the red flags,
 
 
01:16:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: all the green flags, I want to see the overview, the system should be able to do that, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes, of course it's all data linking.
Julien Machot: Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And then you have change log. So for example, if new data has been created, it would be here. If something has been changed, a new document, it will be here. Everything will be here.
Julien Machot: Yeah, exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah. So this is basically the page for each entity. Um and it's my first try. Okay. So let's go back.
Julien Machot: That's amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh so yeah we review the dashboard um the messages. So yeah here in messages you can see uh Q2 right.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I wrote a message from the investor port.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I said hey everyone. So here I can uh you know answer whatever I want. So the message is sent and can be received from the investor as well.
 
 
01:17:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And uh so I can start new chat right new chat I can give it a name um so this no this is the first message so let's say I want to start a chat with Fred right I can
Julien Machot: Okay. Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: just type on it or select investors or staff people right so let's say I have Fred and Julian here I can create start conversation and it will create a conversation with Fred and I can chat with Fred chat
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: will be able to see the messages and answer me as And yeah, then you can also delete conversations.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if I want to delete it, I can delete that. It's gone. I can create groups. Uh let's say group name, we say Q for um I don't know Q4 versus fun or something.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh initial message if it is needed. And then I can select the the the member. Let's say Fred, um, Julian, um, Gles, Alex, John Smith, everybody.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can select everybody and I can create new group and everybody will be inside the group.
 
 
01:18:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for participants and everybody will be able to, you know, see the messages and everything and delete as well can be uh, possible and you can delete messages if needed as well.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, yeah, I added it.
Julien Machot: So technically um technically is it possible for staff to uh select all the clients to send a message or not possible?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I I just don't have a feature for it. It's called broadcast investor broadcast where you can basically send a message and all investors will basically receive it. I think I thought about it. Uh also like an automation every time somebody is added as an investor they should receive a new message automatic welcome message.
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah and yeah broadcast for all investors also possible. I will just add the button later. And yeah, basically the Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay. And we'll have certain roles that cannot touch it, cannot send a message to everybody and some roles who can.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:20:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So it will be role based.
Julien Machot: Okay. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And approvals is next thing. approvals are is when uh they create a new um deal commitment, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So deal commitment um to be to have access to the data room, right? And so it will be shown here and you can basically agree on it.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um reason let's say yes, confirm. Once you so this is to enter data room no issue.
Julien Machot: Wait, is it is it at the NDA level to enter the data room or it's a new investment you mean? Okay. But I suppose uh suppose in this uh folder approvals it would be all the approvals right investments compliance opening accounts I could have all sorts of things right
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. I can add all of them. So, yeah, exactly.
Julien Machot: yeah so my job so my job will be uh with also Fred probably will be to make sure that we click and approve or reject.
 
 
01:21:08
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, yeah. And then you can Yep.
Julien Machot: Uh if we approve it unlocks something then the investor gets a message uh confirming good job uh it's approved you can go ahead and if we say no then um we will need to uh prepare a message that
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yep. Of course. Yep. This Yeah.
Julien Machot: goes into the investor's inbox and it's going to say something. It's going to say, "Oh, it's rejected because the price is not good or it's I I don't know like compliance. You're
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: missing some documents. You need to add your documents before you can apply." Something
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: like that. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, yeah. When you click for example on accept, you have a message that you can add here. It is optional. And then you click the button, it is accepted. When you click reject, you can also add or like a rejection reason, right?
 
 
01:22:02
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can choose something if you would like and also additional details. And once you click confirm, you will be um I think some kind of a chatbot inside the messages. It will be like a conversation which is notification, right? Every time something happens, it notifies you.
Julien Machot: What?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if you have been accepted, notifies you. If you have been rejected, it notifies you with also um the additional details to it. And yeah, so when someone for example when you approve this, it will issue um a task for them which is to sign the NDA. The NDA will be available um let's say inside the documents um for them and they go there, they sign it. I think um I can also add like I was thinking about adding um something like Doy sign open source to the platform so that they can do it from the platform directly and yeah and then once it's signed
Julien Machot: Yep. Mhm. Mhm. Um yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um Yep.
 
 
01:23:04
 
Julien Machot: Can can we um so wait so um can can we manage those signatures ourselves uh without I mean because doign if they have a docyign account maybe they can use it but it means the clients are paying for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure it is.
Julien Machot: it. What we want to do we want to stop stop paying for docuign because it's it's ridiculously expensive. Um but we would like to have our own signature system with um every time there's um a click or a validation of the client for signing a document, it should give uh a unique identification number so we can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: have it in our database and we know we can we can proof check that it's it's it's real.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: You know what I mean?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yep. Totally. I think there is open source uh versions of Doky Sign.
Julien Machot: Okay, cool.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will be integrated with platform.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um. Yep. Okay. Uh yeah. So this is basically the approvals thing.
 
 
01:24:11
 
Julien Machot: That's very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can export. Yeah, you can export everything. You can filter by critical priority uh and assigned to me or not assigned to me. And yeah, you can refresh, export everything. Yeah, basically that. Okay. Deals and Yep.
Julien Machot: That's really good. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is deals. So you can filter, you can search deals, you can uh select by type, newest, sort them, manage entities. So when you click on manage entities, it takes you to entities. You can click on plus deal. Uh it will show you right away. And there is each deal here. Uh and also few more details to see the entire page of deal here.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So uh yes there's an overview inventory members fee plan commitments documents and activity for now this is just um I think
Julien Machot: Yeah. Oh, I I have uh one idea um which is actually very important. Um I want to make sure that um in this entire platform I want to make sure that screenshots are are blocked.
 
 
01:25:27
 
Julien Machot: You know what I mean? Um yeah I I want to make sure that you cannot just do a a control screen whatever screenshot because this information is sensitive.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: I don't want anyone to be able to do that and pass it on, you know, to someone else who's not authorized.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. I will I will look into how I can do this.
Julien Machot: Very important. Yeah. I know certain um for example, when you go on booking.com and you try to take a screenshot of your reservation, it doesn't work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it on uh desktop or also on um phone?
Julien Machot: Uh it's blocked. I think it's both.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah, on phone for sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Then here is Yeah.
Julien Machot: On the mobile I know it's blocked. Um, yeah, correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. also banking uh apps my bank as well when I can't I can't take screenshots. Okay, got it.
Julien Machot: Yeah, you're right.
 
 
01:26:23
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, this is overview um inventory. So, I can add shares um lots um members.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I can add members via either investors or um should I add um so what do you think the members should be here?
Julien Machot: Yeah. and the members.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah sorry this section is to basically you know in the active deals inside the investor platform they have to be invited to each deal right they can't see all the deals.
Julien Machot: Uh Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when you add members um select investor right you could select the one um that you need and it basically is here and yeah me number you could also add email or generate invite link.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Okay. Okay. No, very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh fee plan this is still up upcoming right. So I will add the fee structure and everything.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Commitments will be the data here. So every time somebody clicks on commit uh to have access to the deal room it will be assigned here as data documents.
 
 
01:27:38
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah so wants to start. So I think the deal room could be something here right you have it here and then it will be um accessed also by the investors once they sign the NDA and give them access.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, that's very good. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And the activity and so when it was started and everything when it was closed.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I also have an idea here. You can see there is um a timeline. Do you think I should add um a calendar view for both portals?
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Right. Where it assigns all um data that is important that has some kind of timeline in it, right? So a start and the finish thing specifically let's say the deals, right? So we can go to calendar we can see the timeline um for each let's say star.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. I I think it's a good idea um because it's helpful not only for the relationship with the investors like for example a timeline in the calendar where we can see the next uh tomorrow for example uh you know
 
 
01:28:51
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Monday's coming um there are uh three conf calls two meetings uh an email that's urgent uh follow-up that's urgent and all of disappears. And that that can help everyone organize themselves for sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I will add that for sure. Okay. This has been the deals um page, the specific deal page.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And from here you can see I can click create new deal. Uh and the way I do it um for simplicity here.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So deal name um deal type company name uh entity. So I can select an entity or I can choose non- entity. So no entity.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I don't have any entity. Yep. Sector age location. Um let's say we enter some data here. So, it allows me to move forward and then I have currency, target amount, um offer price per unit, um minimum investment, maximum investment, next.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
 
 
01:30:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And I have the open date, the close date, um description, investment thesis, and when I click on create, it creates it.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah. Okay. Very clear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So this is uh the deals creation for now. Okay. Uh entities already went through it, right? Yeah.
Julien Machot: Y muted. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So um no invest uh investors management. All right. So I have investors uh obvious.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So you can filter and everything. You can see investor. Um for example, the one I showed. Yeah. So this is the one I went through the investor portal with, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, I can see the details. Um, so real. Yes. So portal users, I can add users to real send invitation. So if you have an email of somebody but you don't, they are not signed inside the platform, you can put your email here.
 
 
01:31:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: it will send them an invitation link to um access platform or you can directly yeah you could select from uh the users that already exist to either do a specific investment entity and this is and yeah so you
Julien Machot: Okay. Very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: can create new investor here legal name display name investor type family office individual email phone number country of incorporation country tax relationship management manager and that's basically it and yeah that is it for now
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for the investors um processes so based on the processes that we already created in N10 right the automations and everything I added these categories so I have document generation I have compliance and verification communication,
Julien Machot: Very good. Very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: data processing and multi-state workflow.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for example, document generation. I click on it. I choose which one. So I have position statements. I have reporting agent position statements. I put in the information that are needed, right? To trigger it. If you want to trigger it from here, I click on this button.
 
 
01:32:34
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will send the web hook. Um it will trigger the Nate end workflow. It will create everything. And if it is a position statement, right, it will put it directly inside the documents that are necessary and also issue a message notification, right? So that's basically it. Uh history is basically what happened before and schedule if it is a scheduled thing.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah, so this is I think the same thing for both and then compliance verification there is NDA agent is KYC processing something new.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um communication. There is shared um shared drive notification.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: is the inbox manager if you remember call processing and so for example C um inbox manager if you remember you gave me a couple of commands uh three commands right so you can give it here and it will
Julien Machot: Yeah. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: do the job as well and you can select either um it is going through email or virt um and the inbox manager works here as or it is through email and you can do it there
 
 
01:33:45
 
Julien Machot: Mhm. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: as well.
Julien Machot: Okay. Understood. Yeah. No, it's very good. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I think I will um work on this a little bit more because I would like also for example right um for the LinkedIn for example leads right do you want it to um do you want this platform
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to have uh some kind of leads data um or do you want it to just basically send it to the CRM and have no mention of it Yeah,
Julien Machot: Um, sorry. Can you hear me?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can. Yes.
Julien Machot: Oh, yeah. Sorry. Can you Can you Can you repeat? Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure. Yeah, no problem.
Julien Machot: Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, yes. So, for example, the leads, right? Uh, we have uh outreach and also um scraping.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you prefer to have um some of let's say the information here or do you want to have it externally uh for now we have it in a DB a lot of it.
 
 
01:34:49
 
Julien Machot: Yes. Um I I think it's if it's okay to keep it in the platform as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So all of this information leads for example outreach um I can have a migration or connect the database here to the platform as well.
Julien Machot: Yeah, correct. Okay, perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So we can connect it up and work from there as well directly I suppose.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this and there is requests. So inside the report uh reports if you're a member of the investor platform you can issue a new request and it will be created here and you can basically assign member uh a staff member to it and change
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. I mean Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: its status and the urgency and close it.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: basically it. Yeah, I think you can create a conversation based on a specific um request.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, documents.
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, for documents you can so this I will delete.
 
 
01:36:06
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um but basically what I've done is that okay you have for all entities you can create specific documents and you can uh go specific subfolders for example agreements legal documents KYC reports and everything basically management documents and
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you can create new folders and subfolders just like Google Drive and then upload documents into it right and that's basically how it works.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Perfect. I think um if you want highs, it's getting a little bit late, so I'm conscious of timing. I think we've covered uh so far the a lot a lot. Um maybe what we can do I let you continue the work anyways.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yep.
Julien Machot: What we can do is um either tomorrow night or Tuesday night what we can do is uh reconvene uh to go to the next sections introducers fees reconciliation the last sections of this presentation and there we will brainstorm
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: on how we um how some of these calculations uh will be recorded.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
 
 
01:37:18
 
Julien Machot: Um, we will do this together if you want. Uh, but already for now it's fantastic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Sure. Thank great.
Julien Machot: What I see is amazing. Um, you're spot on, I think, uh, with the platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, great to hear. Yeah, I think we can uh do that. No problem. Um I will it's also the last ones uh from introducers to admin.
Julien Machot: Fantastic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I didn't develop them as much uh because I had to finish all of it so that they can basic Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, of course. Yeah, but we can we can definitely um discuss it either either uh either tomorrow uh either tomorrow night or Tuesday night. I let you continue the work because you're progressing very fast.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, but this is very very good already.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
