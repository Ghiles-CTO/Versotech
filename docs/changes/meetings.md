Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Julien Machot: Hello. Helis, how are you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: How you doing?
Julien Machot: Hey, I'm good. I'm good. Good morning.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Good morning.
Julien Machot: Okay, great to connect. Um, and thanks for your voicemail as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um, yeah, so I guess uh looking at the looking at the schedule and the workload we have, um, I was thinking this, we're almost now um almost in November.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: So basically the main question for you is how do you see uh the next steps and how much work you think there is to be able to start launching uh and looking at the schedule uh ideally to try
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: to get uh to try to launch the platform you know uh towards if we can uh mid December maybe latest you know like before Christmas and all so we can have a soft launch and then in January we'll
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. Mhm.
Julien Machot: do like um like a proper launch, right? We'll we'll really communicate about it.
 
 
00:02:03
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. All right. So, um we will need to define what we will need uh what we will all like everything that we will have mid December. All right.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: and also um what we would finalize in January. Right. So now I can share my screen.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We can go uh how do you want to start? I can go uh as usual through the platform, show you what changed, what I'm working on and all.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Sure. Sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Excuse my voice a little bit. I have a cold.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. I heard you were sick. I hope you're going to get better soon.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Julien Machot: You need to eat kiwis.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. For vitamins.
Julien Machot: And ultimately for the for sort of trying to find uh bugs or trying to make uh some changes uh if you want to create like an account I can start using I can start looking into the details.
 
 
00:03:07
 
Julien Machot: Uh maybe that that'd be nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I will send look uh it is deployed here. So how it works? I will tell you briefly here. Um so this is deployed in versal right vers.com is a platform you can deploy NexJS project and the and the code is based on nextjs.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can see if I click visit it goes to the URL and then you have everything right. So I can send you the URL which I'm doing and So for example for the staff portal I can go here sign in um I have couple of uh accounts created for example the CTO at versholdings.com password is 123123 um and then we sign in it's uh an account named on on you see it's Julian Mash is mash right Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Uh, yes, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Julia or Julian.
Julien Machot: Um, well, in French you would say Julian, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Julien Machot: And then because I'm always uh surrounded by English- speakaking people, they're used to Julian.
 
 
00:04:25
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. For sure. All right. Yeah. So, this is the um Yes. So, we will send you credentials uh and the link. So the link you already have it um credentials for stuff and also investor so we can test it you know um I send it before but I think I changed it uh because I wanted to create you know
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: accounts on your name um and Fred as well he there is an account for him so yeah uh what I've changed um since was P I mean I added the the logo um let me go through stuff. I added more details about the deals. So, each deal has more details. Now, um the term sheets here, I can add a term sheet uh with more details.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so, interest reflects here. Data room, I can grant access to investors. I can upload files to it. Inventory shows here. Members, um I can add members uh remove them. fees, documents, same thing, activity.
 
 
00:05:35
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, this is basically it for the deals. There's advanced filtering as well. Um, yeah. So, you can filter the deals however you want. For the entities where I have done uh most of the work is I I've I've added all of the entities that you gave me. You can see here. So with uh the data they give me. So there's the code either VC um re or EN with the number. There's I think another code. This is what I've created. And this is the the name investment. So the company I suppose the platform the type the status which is live um closed or to be determined. uh the investor. So the amount of investors open flags which is um the health of uh the u yeah so the entity uh less activity and all of that. So you can I can I've added like more details like how to filter them view and all. I think um we would hold each a little to make it more um but yes so for example if I go to um eat just stable time investment so here there is the overview which is um
 
 
00:06:48
 
Julien Machot: Fantastic. Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah so overview which is uh entity details and all which is metadata and then I have investors investors where you will see the data um that looks like this. So this is a subscriptions for now. So, structured insurance limited um Kale United and this is the subscriptions and yeah, so there is a status uh of the subscriptions. This reflects directly inside the the stuff portal as well. Uh I mean the investor portal can see things. Sorry.
Julien Machot: Uh, sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Julien Machot: Uh, let's just one second. Give me one second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Thank you. Okay. Yes, I'm with you. Thank you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So inside the investor field you can see the subscriptions and the investor. So each investor with the name and their subscription right and you can change the status and all committed and everything.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This will be seen also inside the portfolio page of the investor portal.
 
 
00:08:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I can add investors. When I open add investors I see this. So select existing investors where I can select from here search for them right. Um and then I can add the details of allocations right and uh with that I can also invite them.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if they already have an email associated to them, right, I can invite them to uh come to the platform and create an account, right?
Julien Machot: Okay, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Because this is legacy uh like the dashboard. I think it's uh you know stuff that already has been done or I can create a new investor from scratch or I can give them the you know email phone number and also decide to send them an invite
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: if they are not inside the platform already. And when I click plus it creates and everything. Now the uh documents and folders. So I can create a new folders inside each uh entity right. And then once I create new folder I can upload documents inside of it.
 
 
00:09:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the upload thing can be done with a link or um yes.
Julien Machot: Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So either a link with Google Drive thing or Google fi uh sorry or like a local file directly. So when I click here it opens my um explorer to get the document. If this works uh stakeholders um I can click plus and then I have the role um company firm um couple of more details I can add directors. So directors I can select directly from uh the staff portal. Um assign director and then deals. This is the deals that have been created with the specific entity and then health. Health health if you remember is what we have discussed. So a couple of like things to track to make sure um the company would work uh sorry the entity works and yeah so this is what I've been doing mostly.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I added this logo thing as well. I've added it for openi. So if I search off my eye here, yeah, you can see the logo here.
 
 
00:10:21
 
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this would basically seen also inside the portfolio.
Julien Machot: Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um Mhm. Um I think yeah, I've done uh also details to the investor portal.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So I changed so the logo a little bit of the dashboard. Right. In the beginning it was mostly about the holdings. Now it is about the deals right and the action center. So about everything that is going on inside the platform. Uh you can you know uh from here you can see everything. You can access the whole day, access the calendar. Um check the sorry check.
Julien Machot: Very nice. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. check new deals at all. Uh yeah, and then you can go to active deals which is the second page. I have changed it a little bit to look um more professional with not a lot of colors and so so for example the there will be closed deals and there will be open deals, right? Uh you can search and filter by um the deal and then once you select for example Yeah.
 
 
00:11:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is notify me about similar because this is an already dead one. So it is closed. So if I want to get notified for similar stuff, I can click here.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will get notified. Um view details of a specific uh so here would be the details. You can see the term sheets, right? Term sheet is here. uh can be downloaded as well if they have um if an if uh sorry yeah if a document of the term sheet has been uploaded from the staff portal can be you know directly um assigned to an investor or downloaded if possible and yeah you can you can start a conversation about the specific deal if you click ask me a question it will start a conversation inside the messages Notify me about similar.
Julien Machot: right? Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is because it is closed. When it is not closed, it looks like this. Uh open.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it looks like I'm interested. Uh view more details.
 
 
00:12:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can click on uh I'm interested. And then it doesn't look um yeah there is a color issue which will fix. But yeah, basically you will put the number of you are interested to bind here. Maybe more details. Submit. And this will create an approval inside the staff portal.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, yeah, portfolio didn't change as much. I added all of the metrics here. It looks more like fintech, uh, uh, UI. So, couple of KPIs here.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Very nice. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The charts, uh, I did not delete. I added them here. And the holdings. So, you have three holdings here. Uh this is all the data I was working with. So I can see the more details about each holding when I click on view. Um we did not get to this so I didn't change it yet.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So data rooms I don't have anything yet uh because I didn't get approved for the deals I've assigned.
 
 
00:13:52
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I will test the workflow a bit later. But I need to integrate the NDA automation if you remember. Um, yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh, yes, that's true.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, and then I added the calendar as well. Calendar looks simple for no problem.
Julien Machot: for for the NDA uh sorry to interrupt you for one second for the NDA automation we had done one one NDA agent uh with uh accelerate it's a a team uh different team um what's your take on the automation of NDAs uh you deploy your own agent right within the system.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, sorry.
Julien Machot: Um, for NDA automation, um, for NTA automation, you you have a process inside of the system, right, to automatically automatically be sent to the to the to the clients or the people we work with, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yep. Yes. Exactly.
Julien Machot: Okay. Okay. Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um and it will be you know triggered automatically after you approve someone's interest in a deal right so when you approve someone's interest it will trigger that NDA which will create an NDA for them and send it to
 
 
00:15:02
 
Julien Machot: Correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: their platform it will notify them and once they sign it then it will also trigger another workflow that opens the data rooms for them for that specific deal. So they will have the data there and inside the data room they will have you remember the um um FAQ and also a possibility to start a conversation about the specific deal and also submit a subscription um uh
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: interest or yeah so they want to buy something. Uh yeah.
Julien Machot: And if um if I if I'm working on OpenAI for example with VC 206 and I want to send an NDA to someone who's not in the system yet, could I go in the system myself?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Could I just uh could I just like uh push a an a link maybe to a person? Um, and then the person will receive it. It's going to be a title that says, uh, Verso NDA VC206, please fill in. Then they click on the link and then they end up in the system where they have to create an account to register themselves.
 
 
00:16:15
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yes. So you can do it from the platform as well.
Julien Machot: Do you think Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is why uh we created the processes tab in the starter, right? So you can go there trigger whatever you want as long as it is uh you know not scheduled, you can trigger it. For example, the NDA is not scheduled. The uh subscription pack agreement will not be scheduled. You would like to be able to trigger it every time you want. So yeah, you put just the email of the person and the information. If they click a button, it will generate it. It will notify you when it is done and send it to them as well.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think yeah uh if you remember, you sent to me the NDA workflow that has been created from a company.
Julien Machot: Well, that's that's very good. Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, do you want to repurpose that and use it inside the platform? Okay. Do you have access to the workflow?
 
 
00:17:12
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, the code of it.
Julien Machot: Uh yeah. Yes, I I I do. Uh I do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And what it was what it was doing was um if I'm in my emails in my inbox, I could send an email to the agent directly and tell the agent VC206- NDA- and then the name of the person
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Mhm. Yep.
Julien Machot: or the email of the person and the agent will handle this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: they will take the email contact the person send the NDA that corresponds to it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure. Okay.
Julien Machot: So if we can we need to decide you and I uh we'll need to decide do we use the code and the workflow the the other team they had done for me or do we do our own and copy paste and control our own like you you'll have to tell me what you prefer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I think um so if we have the workflow of the other team, we can just take um because like they created a template with placeholders, right?
 
 
00:18:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the only thing you do is create a template with placeholders and once you send the information that you need inside the template the automation just will take the information put it there and it will render a PDF
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for you and then uh process it with maybe docu sign or another um e signature thing and it will send an email to the person right so it's not um complex uh if we have the workflow we can
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: take it repurpose it if you like the template template, right? That snippet of the template, we can repurpose it or we can create something from scratch. It I think it will not take more than one or two days on that.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: Okay. Very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. So, this um is the the uh what is it again? Yeah. Calendar. So, I added a simple calendar view for now.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So we can see this is the deal window and uh magenta I think the color this is the task um so orange is task medium task high priority blue is pri standard priority so you can see here how it looks this is for the investor and yeah so I can go to reports I consolidated both reports and documents so they can access the documents from here as well and the reports from here while both work and
 
 
00:19:42
 
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: do their uh yeah so you can see all documents reports works tasks I didn't do I think changes to the tasks so far I added notifications as well so you can be notified on specific thing instead of sending
Julien Machot: Yeah, very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: messages every time you would like to you know let messages be uh not spammy and the notifications um you know alone.
Julien Machot: Yeah, very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, this is basically what I've been working on. Uh there is a lot of work in the back in the back end because I need um so I needed to take all of the data of the dashboard you sent to me which is this one and you know take it uh normalize it and use it inside the platform. But I still have a couple of questions.
Julien Machot: Yeah, this is the uh the dashboard. So I happy to help you uh go through it and understand what is what so it'll make more sense for you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
 
 
00:20:55
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, first question I have is um let me just go inside the staff portal. Yeah. So first question is the entities right? So inside the first document you sent to me for if you remember for the reporting right you sent to me a document of all of the entities uh and then the reporting um etc. So there is a different
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: code for it right. So the code um here uh inside the dashboard is all VC right VC1 and VC 44 but um inside the docu the other document there is for example EN um there is E there is VC
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: sorry Yes.
Julien Machot: Oh yeah, I know why. I know why. I can Yeah. Okay. I understand. The reason why there is this is the dashboard, the Excel spreadsheet you've received. Uh these are the former codes that we had. We have replaced them. Let me if you go to your Excel spreadsheet, I'll tell you how this works.
 
 
00:22:06
 
Julien Machot: It's very simple actually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I I'll show you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Um when you take here for example VC28 which is an investment in Sven VC28 we created a a vehicle to replace it which is called VC 128. So we seen 1 to8 all the vehicles you see here
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Julien Machot: keep the letters VC and added up one before the numbers. So if I take another example if you take VC7 well VC7 is actually VC107.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Mhm. Yes. Yes. Uh if I go to 128. Oops. If I go to All right.
Julien Machot: Yep. If you go to 128 it means it was 28 VC 28. So sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um.
Julien Machot: So in the datab in the Excel Fred should have updated it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: when you have um VC 206 if you remember VC 206 for open AI when we have number two instead of number one after VC that's the second Verso Capital legal entity the first one is called Verso Capital 1
 
 
00:23:14
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: SCSP the second one is called Verso Capital 2 SCSP the Verso Capital 1 or VC1 plus numbers it's the legacy business That's how you can know that it's a legacy investment because it's number one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Number two is the new business we're doing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, okay. I I understand. So, is it possible for me to um instead of comparing it with the VC naming, I would compare it to the opportunity? So if it is open AI, it is open AI directly here as well.
Julien Machot: Well, it's a bit tricky because we may have uh three or four different investments with different entities that refer to OpenAI.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should we do that? Mhm.
Julien Machot: So, it's going to be a little tricky for you and it could induce you into some potentially some database errors.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So I think it's better for you to keep what you have now in the system is actually correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: I think uh uh wait I I see on the screen right now on the screen right now at the top of the screen just pre IPO VC20 this is not possible this one on a little bit on top
 
 
00:24:24
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Mhm. to uh um this.
Julien Machot: uh two rows on top so this one for example just preipo uh there's a there's a mistake it doesn't there's something wrong there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: This one for example is not possible because it cannot be VC20.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, okay.
Julien Machot: It has to be 206 or 254 or 212. So it means there's a Yeah. And there was a glitch because I see uh it says just and then it says TTL which means there's a mistake. I'm not sure what it is.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So 20 is not something that exists.
Julien Machot: VC20 doesn't exist for sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I think what you Yeah, I think um how I did it is that if um because I added the the data right the PL the dashboard I added it so far but I did not do I think
Julien Machot: It does. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh a complete um yeah I think I did some mistakes because of the naming etc. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Oh, I see. I see.
 
 
00:25:44
 
Julien Machot: I see. I see. because in the in the dashboard there is VC20 uh just but actually it becomes VC 120 that's why uh yeah yes yeah
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, all of them is one to zero. Uh but there is the other one which is two instead of one. And how do I know which one it is? Um is there like a rule for it or should I expect an input?
Julien Machot: no no so uh the rule is very simple so uh all All the numbers you see right now on your screen, they are related to the entities VC2 or VC1 and then we just add up the numbers behind
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: them. Anything called VC1 is legacy business is the business of the past seven years uh seven or eight years and all the VC2 business is the business from the end of 2024 until now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Understood. Okay. Understood.
Julien Machot: So actually for me when I have my account and I can go and check myself I will immediately spot if there's any mistake I will be able to do it.
 
 
00:26:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, of course.
Julien Machot: I cuz I know you know I know them by heart, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. So, this is why uh if you remember I told you I would like to split the investors page into investment subscriptions. So you can go there and you know like upload subscriptions or uh fix anything that you want right in the entities as well you can delete it you can do whatever you want. So the editing power is full on the super admin uh that would be fine. Yeah. So I will because there is like um there is both VC one uh 40 41 for example and also VC41 right. So you can see VC17 as well here.
Julien Machot: That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So I will fix that. Um all right.
Julien Machot: Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um couple of more questions. For example, there is uh other things like the GM which I don't know what it is. Um and the other account here.
Julien Machot: Where do you see?
 
 
00:27:56
 
Julien Machot: Where do you see it? GM.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So after summary the sheet after summary it's GM and I don't know what it is. So there is opportunity vehicle.
Julien Machot: Oh, I know. I know. Uh, it's JM, right? JM.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: Yeah. So, these are positions that I own.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So, these are my positions, but they are copy paste and extractions from the other sheets.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, I thought about it but when I've done uh GM, I thought okay, it stands for Julian Mashot. So what I've done is uh I compared the information uh that you have here for example the investments and all and the information that are here some of them are not very correct.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for example.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah. So, we'll need to do um once we launch the system under my name, we'll do a verification.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, sure. No problem. So, now that I understand uh should I stick with uh the information that is inside VC for uh for your sheet or should Yep.
 
 
00:29:08
 
Julien Machot: Yes, inside the VC the JM sheet at the moment you don't have to worry about it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Uh yeah, that's fine.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All good. And so there is a couple of other accounts at the end which is ISco accounts and Yeah. So Isco account should I pay attention to them or is something that shouldn't be Mhm.
Julien Machot: So uh uh so at the moment uh for you you don't have to take care of it right now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Um what's what is this uh folder? uh this folder or this uh file. It's um it's all the previous payments that we so we we we receive an extraction from our lawyers because we use the lawyer's bank account to receive wire transfers from our investors and we also pay certain bills from
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: there. So this is an extraction where you see uh the different uh transactions in in in the bank.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. Mhm. Okay. Hello.
Julien Machot: P. Sorry, I'm back.
 
 
00:30:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Sorry, I had a call that disturbed me. Um, yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, these are financial information from the past that Fred has been using. So, we need to ask Fred uh what to do with it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: I think uh I think it would be probably very good to to load them into the system and to have some sort of a single reference that marks it as a legacy uh book of transactions.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep.
Julien Machot: It's the legacy of every two or three days I request from my lawyers a Excel extraction of all the movements all the incoming money and all the bills we've paid.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So it looks like this one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And we should have in the near future in the reconciliation part of the system, we should find a way to retrieve this data automatically and reconcile it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So yeah for the data columns and all uh columns and uh yeah so just columns for example right.
 
 
00:31:40
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if I go to VC most of them are named the same way right. So there is index opportunity, first name of the investor, last name of the investor and all um until the beginning as well.
Julien Machot: Yeah, sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Some of them. Sorry.
Julien Machot: No, I'm with you. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, some of them I think. Um, yeah, I think all of them match the same thing, right?
Julien Machot: Uh, yes, I think so.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think only VC it's uh different. It's it's called counterparty and um yeah and the other one start your opportunity and all. So we have the same naming also for the accounts uh we can directly I can create a way to upload entire excels instead of you know doing it manually one by one uh for later.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for the data that we have right now I will add it inside the database but I'm talking about what we will have later on. Uh if for example you get another sheet and you want to process it, you can directly upload it.
 
 
00:32:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: But what um what is needed is that the same columns are present and the same naming of the columns, right?
Julien Machot: Yes, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And beed without issues. That's basically it.
Julien Machot: Yeah, exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: and the and the numbers you find here there is so many uh columns with different types of fees and out of the fees that we earn that are paid by the investor at the beginning then there are certain
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: fees we must pay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So uh they come into deductions which means that the fee that stays in my pocket is deducted for is reduced by what we pay to an introducer or a partner. Right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Good idea.
Julien Machot: So that's why
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, yeah, I think so far um for the workflow, deal entity uh investment uh in uh investment investor and processes. I understood everything about it, approvals and all. uh what is what I need to understand a little bit more is the introducers the fees and the reconciliations so I know how to go into them and build them as well.
 
 
00:34:05
 
Julien Machot: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So there um if you want to take uh one of these uh dashboards, you can take any any one of them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um Sure.
Julien Machot: Can leave me here the trees. It's perfect. Oh, here here it's perfect. Sorry. Give me one second. I'm going to pay for the taxi. One second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay, sorry about this. I'm with you. So if if you look at um Okay, so if you look at one of those, this is Nitro. This is three, I suppose.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So um if you take um let's take the first line at the at the top. Um Muhammad um okay, so we have Nitro is the company we invested in. The sourcing contract referred to a term sheet which was a series seed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: Uh Muhammad uh is the client who's come in. Um Muhammad Asgar um sometime there's an entity. So here it's Metronic.
 
 
00:35:39
 
Julien Machot: Uh so the client is a CEO of the Middle East and Europe for Metronic which is one of the largest medtech and biotech company in the world.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yep.
Julien Machot: It's listed in the New York Stock Exchange.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And then what you can see in those numbers, you can see an amount invested. So amount invested is $120,000.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: There was a price per share at the time there was series C. So it was early. So the price per share was only 0.044. So it's 4 cents of a dollar.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: Uh sometime the price per share can be 100 a,000 but sometime it can be 0 something.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: It means that the number of shares he bought is 2.7 million shares.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: And what happened over time the ownership position so so he bought this at the contract date which is 1110 2020 that's when he subscribes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yep.
Julien Machot: So he has 2.7 million shares for the money spent.
 
 
00:36:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Now on top of the money we charge some fees.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So um you can see column R very simple subscription fee.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So what's it when you uh spend 100 I will charge you 2%.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So that means $2. So you have to wire to me 102 $12.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: So that's what it is. So you see the calculation here. The subscription fee in dollars is $2,400 which is the 2%.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep. Yes.
Julien Machot: So if you look at column T, column T is called performance fees.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Performance fees 20%. So what is it? If the company performs, the price per share goes up.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: We report it in the system. So we're going to have to monitor how companies uh increase their share price and their value. We have 20% which is on the performance. So you will take for example a new price.
 
 
00:37:50
 
Julien Machot: Let's say the new price per share is not 0.04 cents. The new price is $1 and the company is being sold to a larger company, a larger group.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: We're going to take the $1 minus 0.04 which is what E paid to acquire the 2.7 million shares. Then you have a number which is uh which is 0 uh 96 and out of that 0.96 you multiply by 20%.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And you find what we get. So we going to get 0.18 roughly and the investor gets the rest right roughly right rough calculations. Sometimes there's a second performance which is in the column V and the column W. The second performance is very rare but it can happen just like here it's an example it happened.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We said if the company uh column W if the company achieves 10 times a return 10x then it's not anymore applicable 20% above the 10x going to be 30% above the 10x.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Got it. And um Got it.
 
 
00:39:17
 
Julien Machot: So these are mathematical formulas. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, I understood all of that. What I didn't understand is what is the cost per share?
Julien Machot: Okay. Very good. So, let's go into the uh the engine. So, cost per share as you can see here was recorded at 0.043. When you go to the column L, column L is the price, not the cost, is the price per share, which is what my investor paid 0.0.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: 044. There's a difference of a a hundth of a cent. So it's it's technically there's no difference technically, but there's a tiny tiny tiny tiny spread. Now uh when you look at um the spread column uh okay so cost cost per share is what my firm as an investment banking firm that's what we pay to the company.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Hey, I understand for share.
Julien Machot: So nitro they received correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. and screen to share is um is it okay?
Julien Machot: So spread per share is that effective difference between how much I I paid to buy the shares or secure the contract with a company and how much I resell it to my clients.
 
 
00:40:36
 
Julien Machot: It's like a margin. Now if you go to another tab go to VC26 VC26 which is now become VC 126. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: Now if you look uh take the first client uh cloud safe and if you go uh a little further right for cloud safe you're going to see a spread which is 172. So the uh column P column P yes here's the spread price per share PPS 172. If you look at column Q $152,000 of the spread that's the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes.
Julien Machot: spread. So when the gentleman came and invested in column K, he invested $600,000 in column K. We actually um had a uh price per share of $675, but our cost per share was lower.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: It was much lower.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So I have a question in that regard. So you make money between the cost per share and the price per share, right?
Julien Machot: Correct. It's like a trader, you know, like traders, they make money because every time you exchange uh some money, every time you you you buy some stock in the stock market, there's a spread between the bid and the ask
 
 
00:42:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yes.
Julien Machot: price. Well, here's the same thing. It's between how much is my cost of supply and how much is the the price I sell to the people.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So we call it the price PPS price or PPS cost and the difference between the two is the PPS spread.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. Yes. Um it's not reflected here the So it's not calculated for example uh the only thing that is calculated is the amount that they spend and also uh the fees and all should be calculated.
Julien Machot: Yes. So, it's possible because this is Oh, yeah. Cost per share is on column E. So, column E, uh, at the beginning of the at the beginning of the table, uh, column E, if you go, yeah, here we go.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So, here is Mhm.
Julien Machot: And as you can see, it changes a lot.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I I'm going to tell you why it changes and it's a it doesn't happen often but here it happened one time in this company which is SpaceX as you can see in the line in the row row 14
 
 
00:43:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: suddenly it's not 500 and something it's 55. So what happened it's like 10 times the reduction.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Well, the company decided that they had too many shares and this company uh valuation was going up.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So they said we are going to divide the cost per share by 10 and we will multiply the number of shares that you get by 10. So divide by 10 a price multiply by 10 uh the quantity of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: shares. And as you can go now to the columns with the number of shares uh further on the right you will see the number of shares increases a lot thousands of shares instead of just 30 shares or 40 shares
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: or 70 shares. So now you're talking thousands of shares. So this is called in finance we call it a stock split. It's a it's an event. It's specific.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So in the system, if we know we have a stock split, at some point Fred or me or you, we would have to go into the system and rewrite the prices and the quantities and then we would issue
 
 
00:44:42
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: a formal letter to our investors to say as of the date of October 23, 2025, please be informed formed that your uh uh three shares you had are now 300 shares.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yes.
Julien Machot: The price per share you had before used to be 5,000. Now it's 50 in dollars.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Got it. And uh so spread PPS fees is basically how much you wait from the from the cost to Mhm.
Julien Machot: Yeah. So you take the spread PPS per unit and then you multiply by the number of shares in total.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Uh so that's all it is. It's a multiplication of the quantity and the spread we get.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: Of course you still have your subscription fees, the percentage and the quantity. You sometime have management fees and sometimes performance fees.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So performance fees I already explained to you. Management fees I did not explain to you. So management fees this is uh yeah this one column t.
 
 
00:45:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh okay.
Julien Machot: So here uh there is in our table something that is missing. We wrote 2% or 1% or 0%. What we didn't say is when and how many times is this going to be charged. Usually a management fee by definition is charged one time per year. So when you see 2% in here, it's usually meaning each year you are with me, you're invested with me, I charge you 2%.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So if you stayed for 5 years, 5 by 2 is 10. Now remember we had a subscription fee earlier.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: uh in the subscription column sometimes you have 2% 3% 0% 5% this is one time only not per year the management fee sometimes we decide we put to zero so sometimes 0% we wave sometimes the subs the management
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Julien Machot: fee we decide it's going to be only applied for uh 3 years not not 10 years not the whole life of the vehicle we're going to say 3 years.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, got it.
 
 
00:47:22
 
Julien Machot: Um now also there's another thing that we need to do. Um if if I just give a contract to my investor and I say okay 2% per year for 3 years I give you a discount.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: You don't have to pay for 10 years you pay for 3 years.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: The problem is imagine that uh Fred he needs to invoice the client on 2025 2026 2027. So over the course of 3 years, Fred is going to have to do three invoices for 2% peranom.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: He's going to have to wait for the 2% to be paid, make sure that it's in the account, reconcile it, then we go through accounting and audits. So technically, what I'm trying to say is it's really annoying.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: It's really annoying because it's going to cost us administration work. So what we do often is we indicate how long how many times for you charge the 2% per year but sometime what we do is 2% per year for 3 years but paid upfront one time.
 
 
00:48:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So we send one invoice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I think yeah I think what is really valuable in all of this data is tracking right. So um the moment you like it would be great for example if you are able to define the management fee structure um and how long you know the timeline and all once you define it the platform it notifies
Julien Machot: Yes. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: your specific dates right or it generates specific complete invoice and send it to uh the company right while uh log uh and so yeah the login is very important so you can look at there and see everything that
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's correct. That's exactly correct. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: happened, right? Uh instead of foreign I think because you will have to track a yearly thing for a lot of um investment and you know some sometimes stuff will uh go you know the angles will be lost.
Julien Machot: Yep. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah. Absolutely.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: That's that's the problem we've had.
 
 
00:49:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, Yep.
Julien Machot: Um I think that it's fair to say um so Fred when Fred joined me a few years back like five or six years ago uh you know the business was starting but the business uh grew up very fast. So immediately I was dealing with lots and lots of transactions and you know I was working super hard and and I I I was lucky I closed the deals. So I get money coming, I get uh investors coming, I match with a share count, I calculate my spreads, I do all this. Fred took my data, put it into these tables. But again, these tables are just Excel. It's static. It doesn't give you cross uh lateral information. There's no analyticals.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: If if if I forgot to invoice someone, uh well, my bad. You know what I mean? Then I look really stupid. I have to write to my investor and say, "Oh, you know that the 2023 uh 2% I forgot to send you the invoice."
 
 
00:50:30
 
Julien Machot: And then the client is like, "Okay, that's not nice."
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: And um and also so this is very very very important. This is the life of the company exactly here because I'll tell you some other things.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: We say here in this table, we say that um Muhammad he came with 100,000 on the 23rd of October. We write it. But wait, how do you know? What's the proof? How do you know this data is real?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: How do you know there's no mistake?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Did he send a 100,000 or did he send 10,000? Maybe I put a zero by mistake. So the problem is this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: We need we need the contracts, right? We verify in the system that everything makes sense. It's recorded. It's typed. It's it's uh it's signed and everything. And then we have the banking uh the escro account with the Excel that our lawyer sent us.
 
 
00:51:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: And then we need to flag okay in the system we have uh in the Excel of the lawyer we have all the transactions and we need to spot the entry of funds the date it was credited and we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Mhm.
Julien Machot: need to make sure the amounts are right. Well guess what? Sometimes the amounts are wrong but sometimes they're wrong because the bank took a fee for €10. So the client is wiring a million but am I getting a million? No, I'm getting €999,90. And I'm like, oh s***.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: You know, it's so stupid, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I understand.
Julien Machot: And then I have to override. I have to decide and click a button and say override. I decide it's fine because it's a bank charge.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. And I guess um you know like a mistake can happen in the day and it would uh fill your entire day because you have to fix everything inside data as well.
Julien Machot: It's a nightmare.
 
 
00:52:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Have some people
Julien Machot: Yeah. And the work you see here, you can see this is like a worksheet. You can see in red, you can see some highlights. You can see there's some mistakes. Fred has been working on it. This is when you know back uh three years ago I said okay I think we've reached the level the maximum level you can do with a pen a paper and a laptop now you need a system because we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: are going to make mistakes and I'll give you an example it's going to be shocking but I'll give you an example last year last year 2024 at some point my lawyer calls me and it's sudden He calls me
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: out of the blue and says, "Uh, Julian, just so you know, you don't have any more money on the escrow account with the law firm. We're
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: at zero." I
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: say, "What? No, of course we're not at zero. We're $800,000." He's
 
 
00:53:32
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: like, "No, no, no, no, no, no. You're at zero right now." I call Fred. I say, "Fred, can you reconcile? We have $800,000 on the $850,000 on the account.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Dupont, our lawyer, he says we're at zero. How's that possible? Well, guess what? It took 11 months. I I I kid you not. It took 11 months for the auditors to try to find out why there was a huge difference of 850,000 between what we had and what my lawyer had.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: And then we discovered that certain lines in the banking extraction from ING Bank when you created the Excel spreadsheet out of the banking system, some lines disappeared.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: We don't know why some lines were not there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: And then uh and then suddenly there's one transaction for $400,000 that had disappeared and we found it. And we told the lawyer, we said, "This is crazy. This money was real.
 
 
00:54:39
 
Julien Machot: It was there. How come you don't see it?" He was like, "No, I don't see it. It's not there." So
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: that's why we need uh so you see the level of uh reconciliation uh and verification that needs to happen is very important.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, for sure. Um yeah I think um okay so for the um reconciliations is this everything or is there any Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um, so it's more complicated. It's a little bit more complicated because if you go towards the right, further right, you're going to see more columns here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: You have So, okay. So, let's take a step back for a second. What we're saying is this. We're saying you have an investor who sends you $100. Now, inside that $100, something will happen. Some of that money goes into the technology company or real estate building, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: That's the capital. That's what I call the capital. That's what we deploy.
 
 
00:55:49
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Part of that money 100 maybe plus 2%. So 102 there's two for the fees. 100 plus maybe management fees maybe 2% per year for 3 years. So there's some additional money due to us. and then maybe 20% performance at the end when everything goes well, we're making a lot of money, everybody's happy, the investors have performed, we charge 20%. Now, out of these economics, we have to deduct what we going to pay to a partner, a bank who is our client or an introducer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: image.
Julien Machot: That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And so we have to flag who the introducer introducer is. Is it John? Is it Gio? Is it Simony? Is it Anand? Is it Gaia? Who is it? Who is the introducer?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: And there are not many introducers. We work maybe with 10 of them or 15 of them maximum. But they come each transaction they they they help us. So they bring a client or or we go through them for whatever reason.
 
 
00:56:59
 
Julien Machot: there's a commercial contract with them. So we'll have to put contracts for introducers and then what happens is we have to pay them a part of the fees.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So now if you look at uh introducers here in your table, John in the first u uh first line of your of your screen, John he had a 1% subscription. The 1% uh there was $6,000 equivalent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: And then out of the performance fee, he's supposed to get 3% if the company is successful, he will pay 3% of the performance.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: Um, if there is a spread, as you can see in the column BMBBN, if there is a spread that Verso is taking, possibly we give a little part of the spread to him as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: So here you can see spread is 24,420.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: If you go back uh to the verso spread, the total spread that we had before uh it was total spread wasund and okay here you go 152,000 and we pay him 20k.
 
 
00:58:16
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So in the system obviously if there is a red flag it would be you're paying too much because you don't have enough money to do this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay this sort of mistake it could happen. I don't think it happened to us before but it could happen that we make a typo.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: There's an error. Um um same for performance calculations.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: If the company uh is going to the stock exchange, it's a success.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: Uh at some point, we will need to freeze the value of the shares. So, we'll need to do an update in the system.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: And then we will need to be able to trigger a redemption event. That's when the client John or the client uh Muhammad, he had invested 2.7 million shares at 0.004. 004. The company sold at $10 per share. Oh my god, it's a great success.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: There's an exit. He's telling us to sell.
 
 
00:59:22
 
Julien Machot: He's giving us a contract to sell. We sell the position.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: We calculate exactly how much money is due to him. Uh we reduce by the performance fees to verso and then we pay out also part of the performance fee to John who's an introducer. So all of this is the system. This is the economic system of Verso Capital and this is where we need automation because this is the I I complain about putting NDAs together and contracts together but the the the most dangerous and the most vital part of our job is this is the reconciliations.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, data because uh you can't afford to make mistakes and Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. You have to do it for every single investment.
Julien Machot: Yes. Every time there's a money flow, every time we need to know that the system is correct because if imagine um imagine my auditors, they come they check oh Mr. Julian, there's a million missing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,
Julien Machot: Where is the million?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:00:38
 
Julien Machot: Where what did you do with it? And then of course then imagine it can become a real problem.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: We could lose our license.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We could end up in legal uh battles. It could be so many problems, right? And then it could it could kill the firm actually because think about all the scandals, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: When there's a scandal in finance, the firms who go into the scandal, usually they die.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: They never reopen the door. Um, yeah. So, so far this is what we have. This is the system where we need to have uh reconciliations and Fred, me, but also maybe our accountants, we are at your disposal because we need to make sure that um the way you think about those um these
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Julien Machot: formulas in the system, we need to make sure it's correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Understood. Um, another question is that sometimes the cost per share is higher than the price per share.
 
 
01:01:42
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So sometimes you lose money on the um on the deal, right? For when it comes to shares okay so I can see it here for example minus 158,000
Julien Machot: It shouldn't be the case. So logically it shouldn't be the case ever. Um okay. So let's look at it. Uh this one 315 shares they were bought at 53. Uh but you can see the amount invested is zero.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay.
Julien Machot: So it means there's something exceptional that happened. Actually I can tell you what this is. This is an exception. It's when we had a commission from uh that we had to pay to uh the BBQ Opportunity Ventures people. It's a commission that is worth $158,000, but they didn't want cash, okay?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Mhm.
Julien Machot: They wanted to be paid in stock in shares.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So what happened is the line before is Verso Management 315 shares as you can see and you can see in column Q the spread PPS fees is zero.
 
 
01:02:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: There's nothing written but the amount corresponds to the same amount as verso management.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I can see here the same amount.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, you buy it and you give it to them for as a payment.
Julien Machot: Sorry guys. Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, no problem.
Julien Machot: You can copy Rock. Uh, he receives a copy. Yeah. 333,000. Yeah. For $2 extra, he's getting additional shares. Uh, yeah. Okay. I don't want to create a problem of reconciliations. keep 333,000 like he said. Okay. So what because remember we had this conversation if you if you say this is a dollar and then you come back to a person and say it's a$120 or a dollar3 the client still has to approve. So if you change it I have to go back to a rock and change it again. Yeah. But then what to do with the remaining rock?
 
 
01:04:21
 
Julien Machot: It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. It's a spread for us. It's a it's a it's an implied uh additional $10 or $20 or $100 for us. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. When when the auditors go through, they consider it's the cost of doing the business. It's the the Yeah. Yeah. It's an it's an operational margin. Yeah. The auditors, they put it in a in a in an envelope. They say, "Okay, these amounts, they're not contractually uh there, right? It's not a profit. Yeah. It's a it's an operational profit. Okay. It happens because the auditors they they recognize that it's not sometime exact science. Uh okay, I'm with you. Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So same issue about the about
Julien Machot: Yeah, we are sending a new uh subscription agreement and I was talking to Ashish and the the client he said to us is very funny. He said to us, "We want $333,333 of certain stock um which is anthropic actually. Um
 
 
01:05:35
 
Julien Machot: and and then uh you know when you add up sometime $2 or $3, you can have one more share.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: But then I I don't I don't have time today to go back to my client and explain, okay, why don't you buy two shares on top? You know, it's a lot of conversation for a minimal impact. So yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, I think I understood a lot about the reconciliations and they would be able to create page for it.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah, this is a real challenge.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yes.
Julien Machot: Uh, but I think you understand, right? You understood the principle of how that works and you can really test yourself if you if you go into any of the spreadsheets you've seen any vehicle, you take any investor, any line, and when you go through those
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: columns, it's going to start making sense in your mind. You're going to see how much the investor invested.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay, fine. But wait, what are the fees?
 
 
01:06:32
 
Julien Machot: What is the fee structure? And you know in most case I I need to tell you actually in most cases most cases we have a spread in the price per share plus a subscription fee.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Okay.
Julien Machot: A lot a lot of cases we have 0% management fee, 0% performance fee. And the clients they love this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: They love this. I'll tell you why. In my uh line of business, um there are so many uh funds that exist and the funds they charge management fees and performance fees all the time that the clients get upset.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Imagine you are an investor in SpaceX for 3 years with us and every year I send you an invoice for 2%.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: It pisses you off, you know? You're like, "Why are you annoying me? So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: so that's the that's what we're trying to to cancel um with with our system is to try to have a spread in the share price where we make more money up front, but then we don't bo and it costs the investor, but we're not annoying the investor ever again.
 
 
01:07:46
 
Julien Machot: And trust me, that is like it's priceless, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: It's like gold for them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, of course. I mean at that level you would rather have as successful experience with the investor than get the 2% investment. True.
Julien Machot: Exactly. That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh I have a question regarding the operations right. So um for example I can go by stock right um maybe an index maybe stock of Tesla or anthropic. Um if it is public you can directly buy from uh the stock market right. So what is the difference between working with you in buying directly stock?
Julien Machot: Yeah, very interesting.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So on my phone for example Yep.
Julien Machot: Yes. Sorry. Uh, you want to? Sorry, I'm with you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So the question was what is the difference from buying stock uh there is public so if I go um in Robin Hood on my phone I can buy stock right but what is the difference between working with you and buying uh on your own Mhm.
 
 
01:09:05
 
Julien Machot: Oh, okay. So, uh the main the main difference uh is going to be that we stay within private uh companies. Uh we don't do listed companies.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: That's the number one uh thing. Um, number two thing, because we're in privates, um, the ticket size, so the amount of money you you, um, you need to invest as a minimum, it cannot be less than $100,000 per investment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yes.
Julien Machot: You cannot come to me for $50. I It's not possible. The regulator doesn't allow.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: It's not allowed. Plus, for us, it makes no economic sense to do that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: Uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: And is there tricks um like for example leverage or not anything like that for the investor?
Julien Machot: Say, say again. Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um is there tricks for the investor like leverage uh on specific investment or there is nothing like that?
Julien Machot: Oh, no, not really. So, we um we we don't we don't today offer leverage because it's very dangerous in these stocks because they're not public on the stock exchange.
 
 
01:10:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: You know, you can't really sell it quickly. There's no liquidity. So you don't want to have leverage.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. I understand.
Julien Machot: Uh you can too dangerous.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Okay. Um Okay. Understood. So you have to be invited from the uh investment opportunities to be able to buy the shares um and then offer it for investors. Is that correct?
Julien Machot: Yes, you have to um you always have to know someone who knows us and you know we know a family member. We know um you know the the the boss of the big business or whatever or a banker and uh maybe someone who works for a family for a trust or for a family office.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yes.
Julien Machot: And uh because the the amounts we're talking about here are sometime you know sometimes they're very big amounts um these people don't actually know who to talk to really uh so I am the person they go to um
 
 
01:11:26
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep. Okay.
Julien Machot: um you know because I I've been in the business for a long time and I'm a former banker people know me uh people trust me u you know I when I when I say I'm going to do something
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: I do it when I sign it's uh authority as a former Swiss private banker we have like a a bit of a power you know it's something that people know right they if I say the number is this
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yeah. Push through. Yes.
Julien Machot: people take it and people people they it's like your it's like your surgeon oh your surgeon comes to you and say you have a weak heart we need to operate we need to go through surgery you you you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Julien Machot: know it's a it's an authority um but that's why
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. Social proof for sure. Okay. Yeah. So, I think I understood um everything that we discussed. Is there anything that you want to add or discuss?
 
 
01:12:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: further. Yeah, I think um what we will need to have in by mid December. What do you think?
Julien Machot: Yeah, for sure. Uh, for sure. What whatever we can do. Um I think um um if if you are comfortable with the explanations I've given you um about the reconciliation work uh we can um you know you can start um um making sure the system will integrate the legacy
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: data and then making sure that we enter formulas that will calculate automatically the sums um the fees that are due to people and the fees that are due to us uh the number of shares obviously and then we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yes. Okay.
Julien Machot: can start playing with it because you and I will be able to control and verify if there's some error uh we just need to get the initial model right because once you load the data everything will uh will
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. Yep.
Julien Machot: uh follow the formulas right Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: For sure.
 
 
01:13:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah. So that will be in the fees and reconciliation for reconciliations for the formulas. All right. Got it.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So I guess by mid December we will have everything that we discussed so far. So from the messaging approvals, the deal entity investment in the investor workflow. Um yeah. Yeah. I think yes.
Julien Machot: I I think you you mentioned something which is very true. What you've mentioned is um the um auto for the system to be able to automatically create invoices or receipts documents that will be in the system sent automatically inside the account of the investors and for example the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yes.
Julien Machot: partners like introducers they send me an invoice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So we must um once we close a deal in the system and we say this deal is completed automatically there should be a workflow that sends an email to the introducers and say dear introducer the deal is closed
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: congratulations now you can invoice us because you have introduced Paul and Mary and Paul's fee is X and Mary's fee is X now send us your invoice and then of course then they will send an invoice in the
 
 
01:14:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: system ID Ideally, they should lodge it in the system. That'd be better.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: Uh, if they send it by email, we'll need to think about optimizations of how an agent can retrieve it from the email specifically, analyze the the invoice and make sure that it's correct. And then uh yes, and then that's pretty much it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Sure.
Julien Machot: Oh, I I think there's one more thing I want to say. Um it's um um one more thing I want to say is when um so we we we have to pay as well right so we we have to wire funds to uh the lawyers the accountant the the the the introducers so it would be good to have a section where people can type in their banking details Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Accountant. Okay. So accounting I suppose. Okay. Or finances page.
Julien Machot: Uh or it can be uh or it can be a banking page.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh that makes more sense.
 
 
01:16:05
 
Julien Machot: Actually, it's interesting if you create a banking page because out of two or 3,000 clients we have, if we see JP Morgan is like uh 50% of the time, maybe one day I just call JP Morgan and say,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Y see I've seen this morning that they changed the headquarters.
Julien Machot: you know, uh we're working very closely and you don't even know it. So funny.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's a big firm for sure.
Julien Machot: Um in the reconciliation work um when you see um when you Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So what I used to do is this. I used to take the dashboard and in the dashboard you can find subtotals at the bottom. So usually Fred wrote the totals the sums. Um so this one is maybe not good example really this one but if you take uh VC6 or VC or VC13 or VC11 you're going to find at the bottom far down the sums.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This Yeah.
Julien Machot: So uh what's interesting with the dates as well is that the system definitely should calculate uh total amount raised uh this week or today or this month, last month, last 6 months, last 12 months because you can extract right this data.
 
 
01:17:42
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: And then it's the same for the for me as the boss just me to know what's my total revenue my total margin my total I need to see it myself other people don't need this interface but me I need this interface I need to know for example I need to know every second how much money I made today how much money I made last week how much money I made six months ago and I can see
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, good.
Julien Machot: the volume of investments right I can see how many tens of millions have come in and and and so it's going to give me some uh some graphs with a curve, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: this. Yep.
Julien Machot: And that will be the dashboard for me as a CEO. It's going to tell me how well the business is doing or how badly the business is doing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Should I be adding that inside the super admin page or is it uh Okay, super admin makes sense, right?
Julien Machot: Yes. Yes. Super admin page.
 
 
01:18:42
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: that is like an analytical dashboard where I could check because for example I can tell you yesterday and today have been extremely busy days for us. We it just happens that we have three transactions happening today right now at the same time.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No. Yes.
Julien Machot: So of course if if you look 24 48 hours uh we are locking in 15 million uh from the clients 15 million we are generating 1.4 4 million of profit in 48 hours.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Okay.
Julien Machot: So you're going to think, oh my god, like wow, this business is extraordinary.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, for sure.
Julien Machot: But there are phases where you don't make any money for 3 months. You know what I mean? It's not uh it's not always the case. So we need to know that because um I'm try my my job is to try to it's difficult but it's to try to have successful transactions happen all the time but it's you know there's so many elements you don't know and you don't control so my job is difficult because sometimes I can make a lot of money in one day and it's blowing your mind like wow like wow that's a lot of money but then for
 
 
01:19:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Mhm.
Julien Machot: 6 months I make zero so Then yeah then that's really really difficult you know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. I understand. Yes. Okay, I understand. Yeah, I mean when you track it, you will understand way better.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And I think analytics.
Julien Machot: And I think um it's not only the money, it's also um for me as the super admin is to see how people throughout the system, how many people log in today, how many people are checking documents, how many
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: people clicked on the latest campaign, for example, Revolute or OpenAI, how many people viewed it, right? So it gives me data that today I don't know. I don't know how many people clicked on my website and checked uh certain things and I don't know how many people read my WhatsApp or how many people opened the PDF I sent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So with your system, we're going to check all of this. We're going to be able to have better insights into the people's behavior because it's there's still a mystery for me.
 
 
01:21:01
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: for sure.
Julien Machot: Like when I call an investor and I speak to them, I feel like I'm doing a good job. I've explained to them everything and they found the clients are nice, you know, they're they're very respectful of the work I do, but I don't know if they like it or not.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep.
Julien Machot: I really don't know. So, yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: So, that that would be helpful.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, for sure. Got it.
Julien Machot: Um um you know, um I want to see something else with you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: um in the platform u when uh in the investor profile uh there's one thing I thought the other day I want to check with you um we need um a strong profile because um you know we have the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: KYC documents right we have the contact details um let me see we have Uh let's see if you have a person. Okay. So if you take one of these people uh you can take any of these people and Okay.
 
 
01:22:17
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I mean for now I didn't uh create the entire thing.
Julien Machot: Gotcha. So we will need all the contact information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We will need uh phone number, email, WhatsApp, whatever like Facebook, Instagram, whatever you want. Tik Tok, I don't care. They can add up what they want.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We will need to um have all their KYC documents with the date of expiration. They need to type it and we will keep it in the systems.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: And then um what we will have there also which is uh going to be like uh gamification is to have uh you as an investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: What do you like? What is it you don't like? What are the sectors you prefer? What are the sectors you don't touch? What are the countries you prefer? The countries you don't touch. What is your experience in terms of uh level of education? um you know uh like trying to create like a uh polls and and then that triggers into charts and then the investor can see his profile and then this is very important because we will use this to match
 
 
01:23:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes.
Julien Machot: with new opportunities that are coming up.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay, we get it.
Julien Machot: and say yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think um so yes. So basically you would like a better profiling of each investor uh by asking them questions um scheduling also tasks for them to answer questions maybe on a monthly basis as well.
Julien Machot: Correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And truck Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, we need to maintain um somehow the system has agents as you know we name them right. We have several agents who who are people basically they're people. So some of these agents will be customer relations will be sending nice emails. When there's a birthday coming they'll be sending like a notification for the birthday. You know we're going to make it like super super nice because then it's a it's a work tool that you're designing but it's going to create a personal link with the people behind.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: And that's there's no banking system today in the world they're doing this. None of them.
 
 
01:24:39
 
Julien Machot: I mean, Revolute is probably doing it, but because they're smart like this, uh, we need to do it, too. Like, we need to send like a gift for the birthday. We need to send like a birthday card for the system, you know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes, for sure.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, I mean, as long as we have their birthday dates, we can, you know, we can ask it as a question as well. Is the investor KYC?
Julien Machot: Oh yeah, that's true.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Yeah, because in the at some point I will have someone in my team when the system is is ready and and it is in testing for us. I will have someone in my team take every single investor KYC in our system, every single passport and ID, find the birth date and type it in the system. You know what I mean? Like we could we could like clean.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it can be done. It can be done automatically as well.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Oh, okay.
 
 
01:25:37
 
Julien Machot: Perfect. Then if we can do it automatically, it's perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, yeah, there is vision models that are powerful.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: They will analyze the ID extra information directly.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Anything else you want to add?
Julien Machot: Um I have another idea. It's a last idea for you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Sure.
Julien Machot: Um you know on on I think it's on Google if you have certain keywords you are tracking.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Go ahead.
Julien Machot: You can create a tracker and it's free. It doesn't cost anything. So, for example, every time uh there's an article that mentions Verso or my name Julian Masho, I receive a copy in my inbox.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh. Mhm. Mhm.
Julien Machot: Um what I would like us to do is have uh the same thing happening uh for our compliance for every single person and entity and investment we make. So if you take John Smith, John Smith, we flag his name, we have a Google alert like this that's coming in the system.
 
 
01:26:56
 
Julien Machot: is coming as a log in compliance.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Um if we have u an an investment in perplexity perplexity there's an article in the press same thing if we have Julia Masho there's an interview same thing and then what it's going to do is I think that
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: we should the reason why I say that is because we we uh discovered a case of one client who um he introduced me to someone who was his friend. Um, and and the guy was in Dubai between Dubai and the UK. My clients introduces me. We were on the boat with several clients and talking business and all of these things. I didn't know. But for 3 years, my client was in court with this guy. They became enemies. And this guy stole money from him.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: He stole about 4 million from him.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: And my client went to court and he just won in court.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: But you know what? I was invited by this same guy several times.
 
 
01:28:10
 
Julien Machot: He writes to me on my WhatsApp. I met his wife once. You know, I'm We didn't know this was going on.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So any uh time there's a press uh press release or article that comes out and it's about these sort of things like it should flag us and we should know about it especially you know if it's a client especially we need to know um I believe it's um I believe it's a service on Google.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, is it a service from Google or do you want me to do research?
Julien Machot: Let me let me uh uh let me try to find it. Wait. Um uh receive um notifications uh for keywords. Oh, wait. I'm going to tell you. Um oh, it's called create an alert. It's the Google search help and it's free. uh create an alert and correct and then you can you can literally type whatever you want.
Ghiles Moussaoui: create an alert. All right, I will take a look into it later.
 
 
01:29:25
 
Julien Machot: So, for example, I'm going to type perplexity. You can create an alert, put some options, the language, the region, the sorts of results, and then you can deliver it to an email address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: Um, or you can have an RSS feed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Ah, yes. Yes. Yes. I know an RSS feed. Uh I've done it for content before. You will have an RSS feed and then you scrape all of it.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So I found it. Uh Google alerts. You can create an alert and look with it. All right.
Julien Machot: Exactly. So this way it covers all the key relationships in our system.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't create an alert. Okay, got it.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will see if I can put it inside um API.
Julien Machot: Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The other thing is yeah, last time you you sent to me the um Perplexity thing.
Julien Machot: Okay, that's amazing. Yes.
 
 
01:30:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So here I'm not sure if I'm able. Yeah, not able to connect to Proplexity. Yeah. So I sent you the the link if you remember for the dashboard in Proplexity, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you want to make do something with it or is it like an interesting thing you would like to do for uh other research?
Julien Machot: Um um let me see. Um can we see on the screen or Yeah, that's the one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I'm looking for the link I sent you. I think this one. Yeah, this Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay. So, this is an interesting initiative uh by this guy called Felipe uh on on on LinkedIn and on the internet. I think these are interesting initiatives. Um and yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I've looked with this before. Uh it's the it's called labs. So in perplexity has many things many features they have this so labs you have you need a pro account uh they have deep research deep research is the best uh out of all of the other AI for researching
 
 
01:31:57
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is what I use in the public reporting uh in the agent that they created and then you can give it modes so you can select the um AI the LLM and you can give it for example um
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: a mode to be able to research the web for financial information um for academics for videos and all of that, right? And with a lab thing, it's an agent that gives you a dashboard. So, this dashboard will basically take all of the data and create something for you.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can see Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, I think this is amazing. Um and um we will uh so first we're going to launch our platform obviously but I think uh at term this is something that we should be able to utilize an idea we will keep that we can add
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Sure.
Julien Machot: up as a perk to our system and then we could do the same for the analysis of certain companies as well. Uh so it's a great uh it's a great example of what can be done I think.
 
 
01:33:09
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. For sure. Yes. Yes. Yeah. It can be added as an as like a reporting for investment for example, right?
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh even with the data that we get via API, we can wrap it up inside dashboard or analytics page for investor and also the staff.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.
Julien Machot: Okay. Excellent. Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We covered some ground.
Julien Machot: Okay, sounds great. Uh thank you so much. I think this is wonderful. Uh try to see how much work you can do on reconciliations and then um we'll take it from there and uh very exciting.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Sure.
Julien Machot: Uh this is coming along together very nicely.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will take today a little bit of rest and tomorrow I will digest the transcript of the meeting and I think I will be able to um yeah do a lot for sure.
 
 
01:34:04
 
Julien Machot: Yes, of course. Okay, that's fantastic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will update you soon on what has been done. If you want me, I can send you videos or we can do meetings. Uh um I don't know if you know Loom. I can send you Loom videos if you prefer.
Julien Machot: I know what uh if you want we can try.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry. Yeah, Loom.
Julien Machot: Yeah, next time we can try for sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um yeah, I mean as you want. So loom is where you know I record my screen with my uh face on it or like voice and then I go through the screen and explain to you what has been done and I said you just do
Julien Machot: Oh, I see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it you know um or we can do meetings for sure.
Julien Machot: Right. Okay. Sounds great.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah, for sure. Thank you so much. Try to rest, get well, and uh thanks again for all the hard work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Thanks.
Julien Machot: We're getting there slowly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Have a great week as well. All right.
