  AND vehicle_id = 'ba584abd-ea2b-4a3f-893a-c7e0999f4039'
ORDER BY subscription_number;
-- Should show: 1, 2, 3...152 (sequential)

-- Verify fingerprints prevent duplicates
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM subscription_fingerprints;
-- Should match or be close to subscription count

-- Verify entity_investor link exists
SELECT * FROM entity_investors
WHERE investor_id = '93e66a5c-1ec1-4b9d-aac8-6ce0a17cb3d8';
-- Should return 1 record

-- Verify audit logs
SELECT action, entity_type, created_at
FROM audit_logs
WHERE entity_type = 'subscription'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
-- Should show create_subscription, update_subscription, cancel_subscription
```

# Expected: 200 OK with grouped subscriptions

# POST - Create subscription
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/investors/[INVESTOR_ID]/subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vehicle_id": "[VEHICLE_ID]",
    "commitment": 100000,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "status": "committed",
    "effective_date": "2025-01-24"
  }'
# Expected: 201 Created with subscription data

# POST - Duplicate (should fail)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/investors/[INVESTOR_ID]/subscriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ [same data as above] }'
# Expected: 409 Conflict

# Expected: 200 OK with updated data

# DELETE - Cancel subscription
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/investors/[INVESTOR_ID]/subscriptions/[SUB_ID] \

#### 4.3 Post-Deployment Monitoring
**Owner**: DevOps + Development Team
**Duration**: 24 hours continuous, then periodic

**Immediate (First 2 hours)**:
- [ ] Monitor error logs (no increase in error rate)
- [ ] Monitor API response times (<500ms p95)
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Check for any user-reported issues
- [ ] Verify audit logs capturing events
- [ ] Check deprecation warning logs (old route usage)

**First 24 hours**:

- [ ] Monitor API throughput (track new endpoint usage)
- [ ] Check support tickets (any Phase 5 related?)
- [ ] Review user feedback (if any)
- [ ] Database performance stable
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource issues

**First Week**:
- [ ] Daily review of metrics
- [ ] Track adoption rate (how many using new subscriptions tab?)
- [ ] Track old route usage (should decrease over time)
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan Phase 6 based on learnings

**Metrics to Track**:
```
- API calls to new endpoints (should increase)
- API calls to old endpoint (should decrease)
- 409 duplicate errors (rare, but handled correctly)
- Average subscription creation time
- Page load time for investor detail page
- Error rate for subscription operations
- User session duration (are users using it?)
```

**Success Criteria**: No production incidents, metrics within expected ranges

- [ ] System performance degradation (>20% slower)
- [ ] Error rate spikes (>1%)
- [ ] User complaints reach threshold (>10% of active users)

#### 5.2 Rollback Procedure
**Owner**: DevOps Team
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes

```bash
# 1. Revert to previous version
git revert HEAD --no-commit
git commit -m "Rollback: Phase 5 deployment due to [REASON]"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy previous version
vercel --prod
# or
kubectl rollout undo deployment/versotech-portal

# 3. Verify rollback
curl https://production-url.com/api/health
# Verify old functionality works

# 4. Communicate to stakeholders
# - Notify team via Slack/email
# - Update status page (if public-facing)
# - Brief support team

# 5. Database rollback (if needed)
# - Restore from backup (ONLY if data corruption)
# - Note: subscriptions created during deployment will be lost
```

**Success Criteria**: System restored to stable state, users can continue work

#### 5.3 Post-Rollback Actions
- [ ] Root cause analysis (what went wrong?)
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Fix issues in development
- [ ] Re-test thoroughly
- [ ] Plan re-deployment (if appropriate)
