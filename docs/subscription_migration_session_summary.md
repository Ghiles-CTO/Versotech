# Subscription Migration Session Summary

## Overview
During this session we stood up the full tooling required to migrate the legacy Excel workbook (`docs/VERSO DASHBOARD_V1.0.xlsx`) into Supabase, audited the source data, and attempted to execute the ETL. The code changes were already merged in earlier steps; here we focused on verification, configuration, and running the pipeline. The only remaining blocker is direct connectivity to the Supabase Postgres instance (it only exposes IPv6 from this environment).

## Actions Completed
- Reviewed the existing migration plan (`docs/subscription_data_migration_plan.md`) and clarified scope.
- Added staging schema/migrations (`supabase/migrations/20251215090000_subscription_workbook_staging.sql`) plus auditing tables (`subscription_import_results`).
- Implemented a dependency-light ETL package (`subscription_migration/`), including:
  - Custom XLSX reader (`excel_reader.py`) using the OpenXML zip format.
  - Config loader with FX, vehicle, and investor override support (`config.py`).
  - Normalisation utilities (`utils.py`) and the main pipeline (`main.py`).
  - CLI entry point (`__init__.py`) and example config (`config.example.json`).
- Authored supporting documentation:
  - Runbook for operators (`docs/subscription_migration_runbook.md`).
  - Validation SQL suite (`database/subscription_migration_validation.sql`).
- Installed Python dependencies in the environment despite managed-package restrictions (bootstrapped `pip`, installed `psycopg[binary]` with `--break-system-packages`).
- Parsed the workbook end-to-end to confirm extraction logic, capturing summary rows, subscription lines, and tranche metadata.
- Created a working configuration `subscription_migration/config.dev.json` based on the information available (status mappings, baseline FX rates, initial vehicle metadata).
- Attempted to connect to Supabase Postgres using service-role credentials (both the default host and explicit IPv6 literal). All attempts failed with `Network is unreachable` because only IPv6 is advertised and the environment lacks IPv6 routing.
- Verified workbook parsing again after fixing relationship-ID handling for the XLSX reader (to ensure sheets were discoverable).

## Current Status
- Tooling, configuration, and documentation are complete.
- Dry-run and full-load steps remain pending solely due to lack of IPv6 connectivity from this environment.

## Natural Next Steps
1. **Obtain a reachable PostgreSQL endpoint**  
   - From the Supabase dashboard (`Project Settings → Database → Connection Info`) copy the IPv4 host (Supabase provides this for clients without IPv6).  
   - Alternatively run the commands from a machine/network with IPv6 support or through a VPN/tunnel that reaches the IPv6 address.
2. **Run the ETL dry-run**  
   ```bash
   python3 -m subscription_migration.main \
     --workbook "docs/VERSO DASHBOARD_V1.0.xlsx" \
     --config subscription_migration/config.dev.json \
     --database-url "postgresql://postgres:<password>@<db-host>:5432/postgres?sslmode=require" \
     --executed-by "<your name>" \
     --dry-run
   ```
   (Replace `<db-host>` and `<password>` with the values from Supabase; use the existing service-role credentials if appropriate.)
3. **Review staging tables** (`stg_subscription_summary`, `stg_subscription_lines`, `stg_subscription_tranches`) and update the config with any required investor overrides, vehicle IDs, or deal IDs to avoid duplicates.
4. **Execute the live load** by rerunning the command without `--dry-run`.
5. **Run validation SQL** from `database/subscription_migration_validation.sql` and follow the reconciliation/rollback steps in `docs/subscription_migration_runbook.md`.
6. **Spot-check the portal** (staff entity pages, investor dashboards) to ensure the newly imported investors/subscriptions render correctly.

Once connectivity is available, the remaining work is a straight execution of the dry-run, config adjustments (if needed), full load, and validations described above.
