# Staff Messages Module – Implementation Summary

## Overview

The staff portal now includes a dedicated messaging experience that mirrors investor communication workflows while adding internal collaboration features. The new page lives at `/versotech/staff/messages` and is backed by the shared messaging schema.

## Key Features

- **Unified Inbox** – Staff see investor direct messages, internal threads, and deal rooms in one list with realtime updates and unread badges.
- **Filtering & Search** – Quick filters for investor/internal/deal threads, read status toggles, and subject/participant search.
- **Conversation Detail** – Reuses the enhanced chat interface (typing indicators, attachments, edit/delete, optimistic updates) with role-aware controls.
- **Realtime Read Tracking** – `get_conversation_unread_counts` helper powers unread badges; list refreshes on Supabase realtime changes.
- **Access Control** – `visibility` metadata plus updated RLS ensure staff view internal conversations while investors remain scoped to their own threads.

## Data & API Updates

- Migration `024_staff_messaging_metadata.sql` adds `visibility`, `owner_team`, `participant_role` columns plus unread-count helper function and refined policies.
- `/api/conversations` now supports filters (`visibility`, `type`, `unread`, `search`) and returns normalized conversation summaries with unread counts.
- Frontend staff page consumes this API client-side, enabling realtime refresh without extra server routes.

## UX Notes

- Initial load shows skeleton until conversations arrive, then the enhanced chat component handles message detail.
- Visibility tabs display aggregate unread counts per category; toggles persist locally.
- Existing investor chat experience remains unchanged; staff replies flow through the unified schema.

## Next Steps

- Hook unread totals into global staff sidebar badges (not yet wired).
- Consider staff group management UI (create/rename groups) atop new `owner_team` metadata.
- Add automated tests for filtering + unread badge calculations when testing infrastructure permits.
