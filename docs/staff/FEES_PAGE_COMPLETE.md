## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Before going to production, test these workflows:

### Database & API:
- [ ] Create a fee plan with multiple components
- [ ] Duplicate an existing fee plan
- [ ] Archive a fee plan
- [ ] Create a manual fee event
- [ ] Generate an invoice from fee events
- [ ] Send an invoice
- [ ] Mark an invoice as paid (partial and full)
- [ ] Create a fee schedule
- [ ] Run cron job manually: `POST /api/cron/fees/generate-scheduled`

### UI:
- [ ] Navigate through all 6 tabs
- [ ] View fee plans list
- [ ] Filter invoices by status
- [ ] View upcoming fees in schedule
- [ ] Check dashboard KPIs load correctly

### End-to-End:
- [ ] Full flow: Create plan → Generate fee event → Create invoice → Send → Mark paid
- [ ] Recurring flow: Create schedule → Wait for cron → Verify fee event created

## 📚 CODE EXAMPLES

### Calculate a Subscription Fee
```typescript
import { calculateSubscriptionFee, formatCurrency } from '@/lib/fees/calculations';

const fee = calculateSubscriptionFee({
  investmentAmount: 100000,
  rateBps: 250, // 2.5%
});

console.log(formatCurrency(fee)); // "$2,500.00"
```

### Calculate Tiered Performance Fee
```typescript
import { calculateTieredPerformanceFee } from '@/lib/fees/calculations';

const fee = calculateTieredPerformanceFee(
  {
    numShares: 10000,
    entryPricePerShare: 0.04,
    exitPricePerShare: 1.00,
  },
  [
    { rateBps: 2000, thresholdMultiplier: 10 }, // 20% up to 10x
    { rateBps: 3000 }, // 30% above 10x
  ]
);

console.log(formatCurrency(fee)); // Performance fee with tiers
```

### Create an Invoice
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/staff/fees/invoices', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    investor_id: 'investor-uuid',
    due_date: '2025-12-31',
    fee_event_ids: ['event-1', 'event-2'],
    auto_send_enabled: true,
    reminder_days_before: 7,
  }),
});

const { data: invoice } = await response.json();
```

## 🎓 KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER

### Database Schema Understanding:

The fees system uses 5 main tables:

1. **`fee_plans`** - Fee structure templates (one per deal/vehicle)
2. **`fee_components`** - Individual fees within a plan (subscription, management, etc.)
3. **`fee_events`** - Actual fee charges to investors (accrued → invoiced → paid)
4. **`invoices`** - Bills sent to investors
5. **`fee_schedules`** - Recurring fee automation (NEW - manages auto-generation)

**Data Flow:**
```
fee_plan → fee_components → fee_events → invoice_lines → invoices → payments
                                ↓
                         fee_schedules (for recurring)
```

### Key Calculations:

**Subscription Fee:**
```
investment × rate_bps / 10000
Example: $100,000 × 250 bps = $2,500
```

**Management Fee (Recurring):**
```
investment × rate_bps / 10000 × periods
Example: $100,000 × 200 bps = $2,000/year
```

**Performance Fee (Tiered):**
```
For each tier:
  gain_in_tier × rate_bps / 10000
Sum all tiers
```

## 🤝 CLIENT HANDOFF

### What to Tell the Client:

> "The Fees Management system is now live at `/versotech/staff/fees`. You can:
>
> 1. **Create fee structures** for your deals - supports all fee types mentioned in the meeting (subscription, management, performance with tiers, spread markup)
>
> 2. **Generate and send invoices** - automatically pulls from fee events, tracks payment status
>
> 3. **Automate recurring fees** - management fees are generated automatically based on schedules you set up
>
> 4. **Track everything** - dashboard shows YTD revenue, outstanding invoices, upcoming fees
>
> The system is ready for real-world use. We can enhance it further with:
> - PDF invoice generation
> - Email automation via n8n
> - Full commission tracking
> - Advanced reporting/exports"

### Known Limitations:
1. Invoice generation UI requires API calls (modal coming in next phase)
2. PDF invoices not yet generated (placeholder in place)
3. Commissions tab is placeholder only
4. Reports don't generate actual files yet (structure in place)

## 📞 SUPPORT & NEXT STEPS

### If Issues Arise:

**Database Issues:**
- Check RLS policies: `mcp__supabase__get_advisors({ type: 'security' })`
- Verify migrations: `mcp__supabase__list_migrations()`

**API Issues:**
- Check server logs for error details
- Verify authentication (all routes require staff role)
- Test with Postman/curl first

**UI Issues:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API responses in Network tab
- Ensure shadcn/ui components are installed

### Recommended Enhancements (Priority Order):

1. **Week 1:** Invoice generation modal + PDF generation
2. **Week 2:** Email automation via n8n webhooks
3. **Week 3:** Commissions tracking + Reports export
4. **Week 4:** Calendar view enhancement + Polish
