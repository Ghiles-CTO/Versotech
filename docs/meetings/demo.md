00:00:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Don't for Hello.
Julien Machot: Hi. Hi. Hi.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hey. Hey.
Julien Machot: Okay, everyone's logging in. I'm going to have Fred is with me as you know and we're going to have um I think we maybe Dan will join.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you hear me?
Julien Machot: I I think he was just on the call with the team a few minutes ago.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um and so the purpose of this is really to give them a a a fairly quick overview product demo type thing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: You're used to it. You know the drill. And uh maybe to start with um I think it's best to start with the user interface what the clients exactly what the investor portal so that see what they see and then we'll go to the back of it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So the investor Yeah.
Julien Machot: Maybe if we let's let's try our best to do it in 30 minutes maybe we spill over a little bit.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um yeah that'd be that'd be fantastic.
 
 
00:01:51
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um Okay. So I also have uh let me share my screen directly.
Julien Machot: Okay. Yeah, Fred is joining.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Great. Yeah. So I also have um diagram but hello.
Frederic Demargne: Hi K speaking. How are you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: How you doing? Good. What about you?
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, I'm good here in Dubai. Warm weather.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Great. Great. How is the weather there?
Frederic Demargne: It's actually very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Nice.
Frederic Demargne: It's just Yakon. The prime is Yakon. Nothing else. And the AC is the problem.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, it's pretty.
Frederic Demargne: Where are you in Germany?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, I'm in the middle. So, I am in a place called Yenna near Vim Airport. So, it's like a small city here in Germany. Um, Oh, yeah.
Frederic Demargne: It's um that's why there was the battle, the Napoleon battle, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, exactly.
 
 
00:03:11
 
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is some monuments that you can visit on a hike. Very nice.
Frederic Demargne: So, it's supposed to be France, supposed to be a French territory.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. You can see um a lot of drawings and like pictures of French soldiers and Napoleon. Uh there is a rock called Napoleonstein which is like Napoleon rock.
Frederic Demargne: rock here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh and yeah, should we wait for others?
Frederic Demargne: Amazing. I think we can get started. if you want to launch your screen share and uh we we might but I'm not sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Can you see my screen?
Frederic Demargne: Yes. Yes. Perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. So, this is the start portal. Then let's get started with the investor portal. Okay. All right. So for the domain, this is the standard um domain from versal that I will change once uh I'm thinking versholdings.com and then login or like investor login and admin for the staff portal.
 
 
00:04:20
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um but just to have an idea how um yeah I mean we can do that as well.
Frederic Demargne: the same. Yeah. And you'll do verse techch.com as well pointing to the same, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem. And they just Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. be the same. It should be the same link whatever the profile is and then just because of how you use user. Uh I know by default verse.com should be the investor portal. Yeah, by default. Yeah. And then maybe for us we can have admin.vers.com because it doesn't really matter for us.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: No. Yeah. I was thinking verse.comadmin so we know where Ohadin is. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I mean this landing page for now nobody sees it. Like when you invite the user to an investor they see directly the login page. So like this where they say they you know they put their password or they create an account and similarly to the staff portal they go directly here and there is no return home.
 
 
00:05:20
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um if the invitation I sent worked you will see directly here and then you log in. So yeah but Um yes I can do that for sure.
Frederic Demargne: Okay. Can can you can you can you can you do us a demo like if I if we were a new user so that we see exactly the flow. You mind
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for first I have let's say to go to the staff um All right. So to explain I have um investors and let's say I want to choose an investor right um okay so for an investor I have to choose one um can I use Julian?
Frederic Demargne: You want to I think you want to in you want to add a new investor. Yeah. You want to create a new one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: You can take me as well. You can take Julian if you want and you can create a new one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So mhm so how it works is an investor is an account and multiple users can uh join it right so and users can be also entities the the reason I made it this way is when I create a new investor it doesn't automatically invite somebody but it's like an entity and then it can invite users to that person so an example is for example for Julian if I go see that okay and I scroll to the
 
 
00:06:51
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: bottom I can see how many users there is. Yeah. So I can see zero users. So I have to go uh to the top and invite someone. I will see if there is an email that is not yet used.
Frederic Demargne: create a new one. Yeah. Create a John Doe if you want.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you want me to create new uh investor?
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. I mean the idea is to do a demo with a normal flow as you know we are creating a new investor and then the investor join for the first time then we actually see a bit the way it
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Sure.
Frederic Demargne: works.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Let me just go and create LSC with play names. uh individual email let's say this phone number this country the US um all right text agency Germany relationship uh manager optional create
Frederic Demargne: We don't here not all the fields are not mandatory right here all the fields are not mandatory right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh sorry what so legal name is mandatory Display name is not uh investor type is mandatory.
 
 
00:08:09
 
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, no worries.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, sorry. I have an issue here. Um let's put this this this created successfully. All right. So here's the user. I can join the user and there's nothing. So it's completely new. I can edit the Yep.
Frederic Demargne: So here so here sorry this is a company so there could be multiple users right there could be two different directors in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Go ahead. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So, you can see um portal users, there's nobody. And let's say I want to invite someone. I put the email here and I click on the invite. Invitation sent. So, I can I send the invitation and you can see it is registered here. I want to go to Gmail. I should be able to register. Um, okay. Let me just open a new Chrome. It would be better to have both portals.
Frederic Demargne: the cookies come to tech.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, I did um I got the email Yeah.
 
 
00:09:26
 
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Just just on that email, we'll need to change the verso by using our logo. So the font remains the same.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, yeah. I mean the reason it sends from Sorry.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. From super base.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, the the logo.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. From the superbase invite.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. You mean you want to remove this base o?
Frederic Demargne: Um I mean the verso bold in the middle of the screen. This one. It's not our font.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: I think we need to um we have a font which is League Spartan.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: League Spartan is the name of the font.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Uh yeah, I did as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I think he sent me the images before.
Frederic Demargne: That's true.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Okay. It's just a minor detail.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, yes.
 
 
00:10:13
 
Frederic Demargne: So there you're the new user. You are coming for the first time in the system.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And I go in Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: And so the video should play. So what I propose here is that the video should play automatically without uh anything without a user who needs to click. Um full screen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So it it plays the key. Nothing happens.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It I I did nothing. I can stop it. I can uh you know go to specific parts, but I cannot skip it unless it's finished.
Frederic Demargne: Correct. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should we watch it?
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, we watched it. Yeah. So, we can you can move forward. You can move forward because we watched it earlier.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Great. So, is gone get started and then I get to the dashboard.
Frederic Demargne: Get started. So, one second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Frederic Demargne: So, here. Okay.
 
 
00:11:10
 
Frederic Demargne: So, you have open. So here the first step should be a user management you know because you need to you need to create basically your KYC information and here you see you see here investor overview verso is it um it's a dashboard
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep. So,
Frederic Demargne: first and why do we call it vo so this is an investor overview um Uh because if you have in future we have it's our yeah it's our platform right but this can change in the future.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. I mean um so I went if I remember I went page per page um like with Julian and I think this um we got I got the understanding that should be a little bit more marketing oriented where like featured opportunities where you can add an opportunity to specific investor um and then it should be be displayed here but for now you can see it's prompt okay KYC verification pending and when you go a little bit down.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There was like outstanding tasks. Uh submit task form, complete your investor profile and and when you know um it is all in the profile and when I scroll uh is the same thing.
 
 
00:12:29
 
Frederic Demargne: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I go to tasks I can see okay these are the outstanding um uh basically KYC and on boarding form. When I go to profile I can see directly.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So uh KYC on boarding there is uh small content information that I have to fill. Um country is mandatory not everything is mandatory and then I scroll below there is uh tell us about yourself. Uh this is a questionnaire and also the KYC is below and it can basically upload the KYC document that I have to.
Frederic Demargne: You're going slightly too fast for me uh for me to review the the screen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: No, but you'll review.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: You'll take your time to review, Fred. Don't worry. We'll take No, just to see. So, okay. So, yeah, you can go down. So, the first thing is KYC verification. It's basically your details.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. Continue. Go down.
 
 
00:13:27
 
Frederic Demargne: Goes down to a questionnaire about the investor with different uh different pages. So here is not a compliance questionnaire. Here is KYC. It's some KYC and some compliance as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: For example, investments preferences. So if you click on continue, if you click on the on the blue green button, continue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh the so I have to fill all of the information.
Frederic Demargne: Let's just Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you remember the two document you gave me about the questionnaire right um instead of making it one one big you know thing that the user has to scroll by I think it's better to put it into multiple
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: steps but they have to fill the information so we can go to the next step.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. So if you so we should be we don't need to have necessarily all the fields mandatory because for instance the tax ID number is not yeah it's optional.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Okay continue. Yeah continue.
 
 
00:14:25
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, when I go Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So that that the fields that are compulsory and not compulsory. This is what Fred and I we need to check because in certain cases the tax can be big issue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So we'll need to verify there needs to be a logic here to make sure that we we don't block the process if all the data is not there but we don't validate the user if we don't have all
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah, um I
Frederic Demargne: the information. So there needs to be a a validation in each screen uh to see whether the information should be compulsory or not but without blocking the user experience.
Ghiles Moussaoui: did not test this step, but I think once you put all of like um necessary uh information. I think here it is all necessary but there something is blocking me. Please complete the required field. But yeah, so the this like the process is you put all of the information and then you can move forward to the next step which is exactly how it is uh inside the document that got shared with me.
 
 
00:15:21
 
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Okay. I gave him the investor question.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But um yeah.
Frederic Demargne: It's good. Okay. So, if you go down and upload documents. So, here an investor will not upload an NDA will not upload a memo and artic this. Yes, you will bank confirmation. No, you for the KYC. We'll see. No, not for the this will be a logic, you know, where we need to just filter the um the type of documents, the required documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Frederic Demargne: Uh here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so how I understand is okay for entity there are specific um KYC documents that are necessary which are for example NDA incorporation certificate memo articles which is a bank confirmation plus ID and utility uh bill. This is for members or directors right? So how it works is if there is an entity um first you need to put the um KYC documents for the entity and then you can invite members and for each member you have to put the ID and the utility bill.
 
 
00:16:29
 
Frederic Demargne: So can you show us how this will work? Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So uh when I click on upload document I can select okay which document do I want you know it is an NDA incorporation and then uh so I can go choose a document anything I have here and upload it uh with expiratory date and it basically uploaded inside and this document is will be basically verified by Verso Tech which is the portal for the um staff uh inside a specific page here. So for um should I get to it right now or should I continue?
Frederic Demargne: No, no, no, no, no. Because let's try to focus on the user maybe not because otherwise it's going to be very complicated for you. Uh so stick to the user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So the user should be sending more than one document. So therefore it should be he should not submit the documents every time he upload them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. So yeah.
Frederic Demargne: He should basically upload all the documents that he understands he has to do and then save it or send them to us for approval.
 
 
00:17:40
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So for now I uploaded one document which is the NDA right.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can see here stat status is pending. So it is in review and the name of the document expiry I did not put.
Frederic Demargne: notification.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can download it again or I can put another document.
Frederic Demargne: An agent will handle it. And will we receive a notification when the when a user is sending us his documentation for approval?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah. Yes. There is a specific page uh called QC review for that.
Frederic Demargne: Okay. But that's there's a notification specifically that the admin will receive.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: We can see later but there will be a notification.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, that is correct.
Frederic Demargne: Okay. So at term the notification which is in the system will be sent to an agent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And
Frederic Demargne: The agent will basically verify it as if it was a human operator because if there are thousands of documents imagine it's going to be like it's going to be crazy, right?
 
 
00:18:36
 
Frederic Demargne: So we'll have an agent just do that basically. And here do you have a the did you implement the um the required document to be uploaded the minimum required document to be uploaded or is just the agent or us manually who needs to review and then once there are something missing then we can send a notification to tell the user that we are missing KYC information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Okay. So KYC the there is specific there is a table in the database that tracks okay which are all of the required documents for the entity and which are the requirement um required documents for the members right and then
Frederic Demargne: Thank you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um so based on that if the table is not filled with all of the required um documents then the KYC is not fully done you know you can verify verify on the entire entity level for the KYC and also on the specific document level. So you can verify the document and then you can verify the like make sure that everything is um uploaded.
Frederic Demargne: Okay, good.
 
 
00:19:43
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Okay, so imagine imagine that the user here is sending all the information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Well, what do you mean? Let's say Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: We are we are looking at a happy flow. Okay, imagine that everything is fine. The user is uploading all the documents that are required. So what will be the next step?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah next step is basically KYC is finished right so now for the user himself so let's say the investor um uh sorry I have to add something so there is also members right where I have I can add member specifically and entities so third party entities um so with Julian he told me through the subscription flow an investor can um basically invest through a third party entity.
Frederic Demargne: Mhm. So, it's an investment vehicle.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Could be a trust, could be something else. Um to be able to do that, I have to create the entity here and I have to add all of the documentation for it, including the KYC for it.
 
 
00:20:47
 
Frederic Demargne: Okay. It's an investment vehicle, right? It can be any investment vehicle the user decides to to to use for this investment. But why isn't it why isn't it the the actual imagine that uh it's one SPV doesn't matter.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: So it's SPV uh family office uh XYZ that should be the user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Frederic Demargne: So, so it could be that they have an a family office entity which has an account but then themselves just like Verso is going to be using multiple SPVS to invest but not the user e well I mean
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, sorry.
Frederic Demargne: it's related to the user it's controlled by them and they have to lodge the KYC of that new fund or new trust or new investment entity just like us basically because have one account with multiple entities. Correct. Right. Reles, you agree, right? It could be one account that has multiple entities just like Verso. And the reason why reason why I did that is because this year I've come across more and more um investment managers who do what we do, but they don't have access to deals and they come for you through
 
 
00:21:51
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So yeah.
Frederic Demargne: us. So they have a Delaware entity, they have series, they are not professionals, they are like accountants or they are friends of friends of friends and they're going to have 20 SPVS. Okay. So then we want to on board them as well. Okay. Okay. All right. Sorry. Go ahead.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh so this is basically it when it comes to members entities and KYC and this will basically be reviewed through the uh verse right and once this is done then the investor is basically onboarded and now um the staff people have to invite him to specific deals right there will be deals they will be invited to uh they will have a portfolio let's say for somebody who already has subscriptions right for the old subscriptions they will come here and they will see their portfolio and charts right the subscription has to be active so all of the KYC applied but I can go for example and show um for an investor where there is already data how it works because there is data rooms where they would have access to specific deal data rooms there is a calendar um for reports as well um so documents and specific reports that they can request test and there is also messaging um so they can message um for now they cannot send directly a message I made it um as a feature so staff have to message them first or if they have an active deal there is
 
 
00:23:38
 
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: a button there ask for a question and this will basically send an automatic message so do you prefer I go to another investor Yep.
Frederic Demargne: No, no. Uh, go back. So, go back to dashboard. So I think here instead of instead of ver I think instead of verso it should be the name of the of the investor here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: It should be the photo of the investor or the initials and then the name of the investor on the logo underneath here in not here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Okay. Okay. So, yeah.
Frederic Demargne: No well no not here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Here.
Frederic Demargne: If you go down yeah investor overview here there should be the name of the investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Here.
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. And instead of the logo, it should be either the photo that the investor would have put or the acronym of the investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Then we have uh open opportunity outstanding task uh active holdings portal snapshot.
 
 
00:24:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: What is action center? Luxembourg HQ. What is what? So can you just explain what the different information here are coming from? So open up the where where does the information come from?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. So, sorry. Yeah. So, these is just copyright I got from the Versa Holdings website, right? Uh the beginning, but yeah, this as well banking group. Um so, this is just copyright and the No, no, no.
Frederic Demargne: I don't mean where where you got it. I mean it's in a database which it's specific.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's just hardcoded text.
Frederic Demargne: Ah okay. So this will need to be this should be we need to see because all this should be dynamic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. No problem. I mean I just need to understand. Okay. For for example this one, right? It told me the name has to be here and the profile picture it is also here.
 
 
00:25:33
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh right. So the profile picture of the investor would be here and their name as well.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah. So I just need to understand okay where is what and what should be dynamic and I just implement it for Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: Okay, active opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So uh there is it takes me to active deals.
Frederic Demargne: So here will be our deals. So if you click on view all deals, what happens on the right hand side?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if I go here, it just takes me here where there is no deals for now because investor did not get invited.
Frederic Demargne: That's okay. That's okay. So, open deals, uh, pending interest, active NDA, subscription. Okay. So, we're going to need I think we have more steps here, uh, than those four, but that's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: And then if you go to the next uh is portfolio.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Should I click?
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead.
 
 
00:26:32
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So here we we agree that uh the user until he has uh we have validated the KYC he cannot see all this right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah so they will see what they seeing right now there is no data whatsoever so it's all zero there is you know no cash flow data available no holdings found um nothing no performance data available no allocation
Frederic Demargne: Okay, we can. Okay, so only so only when the KYC is done will the user be able to start um to start viewing opportunities and engaging with us, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: data available yeah so yeah the how we works is there is an approval page step in verse tech. So let me show you uh here there is an approval that everything goes through this approval. So when I click on this there is information when I am interested in a specific deal that is open. I can click I'm interested and this will create an approval that I can see here as um the staff members and through here there is okay I can approve it and I can reject it.
 
 
00:27:35
 
Frederic Demargne: We're going to move it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can do multiple things. I can see the timeline and all of the information and also the status of the KYC.
Frederic Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for example, KYC status is approved. Therefore, I can accept it without having any trouble with the investor.
Frederic Demargne: Okay. Okay. Would there be a case where exceptionally my investor has not finished the KYC and I can still approve them to look at OpenAI? Could I do that?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Frederic Demargne: prospects they will wait right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is uh why it's it's dynamic. You can approve whatever you want even if they don't have the KYC. So the power is to the staff you know.
Frederic Demargne: So as long as long as we have our compliance agents who follow up regularly on each account and making sure there's no deficiencies in KYC documents, we're okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: But also as long as um um at the m at the moment the the prospect wants to invest in open AI for example he must finish his KYC obviously we we cannot of course welcome an investor if the
 
 
00:28:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: KYC is not finished anyways so there's a level of protection for us.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yes. So there is you know um there is a main workflow that works um that goes through you know creating the deal to inviting the investor.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Investor sees the deal, investor submits interest, right? Interest creates an approval.
Frederic Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Even if the KYC is not approved, right? KYC as they say is pending. The approval is accepted and the basically this will generate an NDA. It will be sent to both first attack before what?
Frederic Demargne: But the the NDA is before the interest. uh the NDA the NDA is generated before the interest before the confirmation of interest because you need an investor needs to see an NDA because he wants to view review more information before he expresses his interest.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. So there is two interest part um you know two interest parts. one is just basic information about the deal, right?
 
 
00:29:52
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And let's say the investor is interested in seeing more, right? The data room. Um, exactly.
Frederic Demargne: the data then there's an end but you can see the high level info of the deal which is like a high level term sheet but then if he wants to go into due diligence the NDA needs to be
Ghiles Moussaoui: So once um they they submit the interest
Frederic Demargne: signed okay it says in interest created and then they put an okay well I need to review this uh I think here we need to simplify Uh, okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh yeah so when I would show I will show you through the platform how it's done and then you can tell me how uh it looks if it looks fine if not but yeah so yeah okay so In
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, I think we should simplify this problem. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: data rooms um there is not no data right now. Data room is where they can see uh the data let's say the documents and what is proper to a specific deal after they sign the NDA which will give them uh a week of time to be able to see the data room of a specific deal and after that week uh that week the basically access is expired.
 
 
00:31:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: they can request more access which will also create an approval. If it is accepted the access will be expended to one week more. So for now there is no data uh but yeah so there is
Frederic Demargne: Mhm. So that's why you'll have to monitor what works and what doesn't work. How many days really do we give them? We said right now we said about a week later, but you you want to follow up. how long does it really take an investor to go through the documents and then you'll be able to trace if they clicked or not. So if you have an investor who's not even looked at it for a week then you know you're going to find a remedy to it. So here you will have all the insights in the admin platform to be able to see uh investor by investor how much time they how many clicks they did and how long have they lo logged in to review the documents. It's It's all done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh clicks not yet but the time they spend and how much time they have left you can see you can expand it and yeah okay yeah so this is data rooms there is a calendar for now it's just
 
 
00:32:07
 
Frederic Demargne: Okay. Yeah. Perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh you know a few uh so you can see okay the tasks outstanding tasks uh calendar has more data to it. Once you have more open deals, there is a timeline of the open deals. There is also timeline of data room and also you know deadlines and all.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can see that here in the report. So you can um submit specific.
Frederic Demargne: Oh, sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think uh yeah I think there is an
Frederic Demargne: Sorry. For the calendar, do you think this calendar can it be somehow synced with a Gmail calendar? Do you think there's a an option so that whatever is there could pop up on the computer of a client for example like an API that sorts out this issue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: implementation directly I can yes yeah probably I can embed the Google platform um Google calendar here and then which means also the um the dates and timelines here will be also applied to your Google
Frederic Demargne: Okay. And then And so we'll we will utilize the calendar for diverse reasons.
 
 
00:33:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: calendar. It's I think Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Uh one obviously the subscription packs, the process for subscription, the capital calls, deals that are closing, uh certain events, if we organize real life events, webinars, uh reminders, we we we can sort this out. And also if we enter certain partnerships and our partners uh want to utilize the calendar to announce certain things. So we'll be able to really use the calendar as a as part of a lively activity of the platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, sure. I think you can do uh there will be you know an override crude uh insert the the delete option from verse tech where you can you know create events delete and edit.
Frederic Demargne: But the user cannot do it. No, the user cannot add.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No. Yep.
Frederic Demargne: No, the user doesn't add. And by the way, that could be an advanced function for members who pay. They could have maybe a dynamic calendar they can use for themselves actually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I mean, I just want I just need to know, you know, what needs to be changed, what features need to be added.
 
 
00:34:27
 
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can do it.
Frederic Demargne: That's pretty cool actually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. So, should I move forward?
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Sorry. And in the calendar as well, we will have the reportings, right? You remember you and I, we said there's a clock or there's a timer on the certain reports and so that will also pop up in the calendar.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yes. Yes. Yeah, that is correct. For um monthly quarterly reporting.
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So when I go to reports here, there is two pages.
Frederic Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is documents and there is um reports and requests here. Let's say I want to generate a position statement. I can click on generate. I can fill up the form and I can se select specific uh holding and they can request the report. This will also generate a report uh an approval in verse. Once it is approved, it uses an automation that will take a look at the holdings of the current um user, the specific holding they choose they chose and then it will generate the PDF.
 
 
00:35:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will send it first for approval. Make sure PDF okay is what you want the user to see. Once it is approved, it will be basically um sent to the investor and yeah quarterly reports. This is your reports, monthly reports, custom request. You can generate custom stuff. Um, yeah.
Frederic Demargne: So here here AI can help there's some of those reports that are done through AI some of those reports are sourced directly by the agents to the companies.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: So I have given u contact emails uh of who to contact for the reports and that will sort of create a very lively reporting uh window here for the clients. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So those are automations in any end um that I already set up for specific reporting and also presume statements some other stuff.
Frederic Demargne: What are documents?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry uh there is there is uh corporate reporting.
Frederic Demargne: What are the documents? What are those documents?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I have to send spec to um a specific member of let's say an entity right an investment entity request some documents from them wait until they uh so the automation will label it and then every day it is scheduled to check okay did they send the documents did they not send the documents once they send the document then the report can be generated or it will be a couple of documents this will be the report
 
 
00:37:07
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is a corporate part and the public uh report is basically you go scrape the internet. I use perplexity search API to basically uh scrape everything about the entity and then it will generate the report for the investor and then send it to them or there is also position statements. So position statements is uh standards based on the examples that Julian gave me.
Frederic Demargne: I think I think for correct me if I'm wrong J I think for custom report I think it's we should make it available but not allow the user to do that because uh because it's going to be because
Ghiles Moussaoui: Welcome.
Frederic Demargne: then it's going to generate lots of calls. potentially and we cannot be on top of all the different news of all the companies. So I think we should be generating a custom report uh depending on an agent or whatever we can set then whenever we do that automatically this report is uploaded for any investor who have invested in that investment opportunity or in that company but I think if we start allowing users to do that then we're g they're going to start discovering things before us that's possible as well yeah and I guess future as well so we'll We'll
 
 
00:38:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I understand.
Frederic Demargne: keep that as an advanced feature for the paying members as well in term.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I think Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, I agree. We'll keep it simpler.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think uh what you mean is okay if it is supposed to be scheduled monthly the user cannot just request it whenever they want. Um is that what you mean?
Frederic Demargne: No, I mean that it should be uploaded for them to see it whenever we decide to make it available for them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah. This is how it works. There is an approval. Everything goes through approval page when it comes to communication between both.
Frederic Demargne: Remember, we should not even allow them to make us a request.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: We should we should have this logic in the admin sector.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. So that the um the admin uh user can define you know to have this for a specific company and then when we see it's interesting well we decide to publish it and whoever had invested in this investment opportunity
 
 
00:39:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: will get access to it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. But but not giving the the possibility for the user to make that request, generate that request.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Got it. Um I can put something like this.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the general request of let's say they want to communicate something let's say they want to have access to a specific deal you know just text that will be shown to invers and you can act upon it so there's no automation that generates anything but it's just a request for verse what do you think for sure yeah no
Frederic Demargne: Okay. Well, well, I I think before you implement anything, we I need to review in in more details uh the flow. Yeah. Okay. The only thing um I'm thinking is for tax reasons. Uh we receive emails from investors who say, "Oh, I'm preparing my filings, my tax filings. Can you extract for me today uh a position statement?" And that should be an available option.
 
 
00:40:17
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: But it's automated, right? It's not manually done. This is possible here. You have a monthly or yearly report. Correct. So they could create we can have a tax report. We can have a tax report if you want. But this makes sense because it's information from the platform. So this we can give them the power for the user to do that to start it. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. The problem is when you start getting access to information which is not under our control. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, for sure. Yeah, I mean um okay there is also in verse there is sorry.
Frederic Demargne: I just one one one qu one question before you you show his come back in the in the user I think the document section is not here uh because here imagine you're going to have all the documents for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: all the investment opportunity you can have I mean 20 investment opportunities where the investor would have and I think we should organize this per investment opportunity not aggregate all the agreements all the KYC document all the position statements
 
 
00:41:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Frederic Demargne: all the NDF across all the different investment opportunity we should organize it per in the portfolio and each portfolio uh investments we should have a document associated to the investment the user the admin for us we might want
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yes. So, how we work?
Frederic Demargne: to have it like this like all the agreements as a yeah more as a filter but for I think I think for the user the it should go into the portfolio.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Yes.
Frederic Demargne: You see where I invested in OpenAI I invested XAI I invested in perplexity and then you check in OpenAI you see all the subscription agreements you see all the you see I think and here obviously the KYC document
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: is different because the KYC document is the same independently from the investment opportunity. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, okay. I understand.
Frederic Demargne: So I think there's an architecture maybe we need to review the the hierarchy of the documentation because KYC documents should be under uh user profile while the rest should be under investment opportunity portfolio.
 
 
00:42:16
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Okay, got it. Yeah, I mean for now there is no data but I will show you when uh another investor if we have time. Uh so when you click for example on NDA right there will be specific entities. So for each entity you will be able to see the NDAs that are under it. So also when I go inside it is filtered by entity right. So first it is categorized by the type of document and when you go inside it is filtered or like a grouped by entity. So this is how it is done for us right now.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, which which is good. I think entity is good. But I think here from a user standpoint you first enter which investment are you invested in and then effectively if you have different entity who invested in open AAI then yeah what you're saying I think yeah
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. I understand. I understand. Yeah.
 
 
00:43:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It makes more sense. Um okay should I move forward or okay yes so this is tasks task is for example for on boarding right KYC stuff the for signatures for signing stuff and for other specific things um but I think
Frederic Demargne: of Okay. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: they are coming because they don't create the tasks are now for just you know on boarding KYC and signatures but I guess there be more. Let's say every time you want to generate a task or like you you need the input from the investor, you can generate it through the tasks.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Actually the way we designed it before is we have a workflow you know we have a standard workflow.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So we have five or six steps.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Uh so the first one is to review a new investment opportunity. The second one is to uh request access to the data data room. The third one is to u um uh confirm your interest.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Frederic Demargne: then to sign a subscription agreement uh then to confirm payments and then to receive a certificate.
 
 
00:44:21
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Frederic Demargne: So those are these should happen for every single uh investment opportunity and for every single Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that works. Yeah, that that is Yeah. Sorry. Um that is how it it is currently working. When I I have to I have to show you this. uh and then once I go here I will see so I can create you know deal and go through all the steps and it is how you describe it. So there's an NDA that is generated for the data room and there is subscription pack that is generated for creating a specific subscription. After subscription uh after subscription pack is signed from both parties, the subscription goes with to status as committed and there will be fee events that will be created.
Frederic Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh which means okay subscription amount is this much, management fee is this much, subscription fee is this much and then you can select okay what do I want to invoice? Do I want to invoice everything at once? You create an invoice and then inside uh it is also related to introducers.
 
 
00:45:23
 
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If there is a specific intro in introduction related to the specific deal or like subscription with a specific investor and in reconciliations there will be you know I can in um add a specific new bank statement data right
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it will looking like it be looking like that and I can match it to a specific invoice that I have created internally. uh which means okay once it is fully founded I can match it here once it is fully founded and the subscription goes active and by subscription going active it will generate the position and it will also generate the certificate for them right and it will be yeah there is
Frederic Demargne: Oh yeah. So, so you will switch the status to funded. So they the behind each uh each steps of the flow there needs to be effectively statuses. So then once the money is is confirmed that he has reached the escore account then it needs to be switched to funded and then once it's switched to funded then we need to automatically uh yeah confirm it to the to the investor and then once we close the investment opportunity we need to generate the certificates.
 
 
00:46:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So yeah for now for example right um the amount is let's say 500 uh or like 500,000 the matched is let's say 466 meaning transaction that the investor sent is 466 there is 33,000 remaining so it is flagged
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: here and when I go to a specific subscription so if I go to subscriptions and then to right if I go to a subscription specific one.
Frederic Demargne: Outstanding.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can see the status. I can see investor, vehicle, how much it is committed. The status could be pending, committed and active, cancelled as well later on. Uh committed date, created time, there is number of shares, price, uh sorry. Yeah. So I can see founded amount. This is okay. How much did they pay and how much uh is still remaining?
Frederic Demargne: But this is the admin here. This is the admin uh view. Yeah. This is not the admin.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So uh well the investor will see okay it is active.
 
 
00:47:37
 
Frederic Demargne: Okay. Why investor? Because here I'm interesting to see what the investor will see. So will the investor see it's it's fully it's funded. It gets
Ghiles Moussaoui: they will see the status right status is active meaning it is completely founded and when it is active the calculations for the KPIs and charts will start applying to their specific holding right yeah I mean
Frederic Demargne: Okay, let's stay on the let's stay on the user just to finish if you don't mind.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right yeah okay yeah so here's a Should it?
Frederic Demargne: Um I think I think here on the tasks uh what what we what we had defined in the first place this should go into the dashboard because the dashboard was supposed to be focusing on the next action. So there so at the bottom of the dashboard we have the sort of a call for the same thing actually there's some outstanding work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, yeah, in the dashboard you can see outstanding tasks. When I click on it, it goes to all the tasks.
 
 
00:48:41
 
Frederic Demargne: So we want it to be a tool for investors to work so they know they've got tasks they have workload they have stuff to do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: We're going to keep them busy. They will start they will complete. Some of them will be outstanding. Our agents come in the back of it to monitor progress, support, um, help them, uh, entice them, etc., etc. Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So, why do we need to have it in two different sections? No, because when you work, when you come for the first time of the day, you're going to check real quick. And then what happens is, um, you sort of want to drill down to the details. Maybe you get used to your task. You see these numbers popping up in blue. We say, "Okay, now I've reviewed my active deals. Now I have more time. Let me do the admin stuff." So we separated what is um the high level eagle view in the dashboard to like working on the task.
 
 
00:49:41
 
Frederic Demargne: So you go down to your task list, you start working, following the process, etc. But I didn't want them to systematically feel like the access point to the task is a dashboard. No. What I want them to feel, however, and that's where it needs to be marketing is that when you go to the dashboard, the number one thing I want them to really see is the new deals, these featured opportunities, right? So that's why so should we should we put this the top then below? Yeah, you can you then you can rearrange it with with real, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: You can decide like how you want to do it. But I want them to come like it's Monday morning, 8 o'clock in the morning. It's first hour of the week. I want an overview of what's up with Verso Tech. Oh, I've got this great opportunity. Let me scroll down. Oh, I've got three actions to do for compliance. Or I have said that I'm interested in Revolute.
 
 
00:50:37
 
Frederic Demargne: Oh s***, I forgot to pay. Right. Like it happens to me today. So yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um, yes.
Frederic Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, basically, sorry.
Frederic Demargne: And then we have messages which is what you what we discussed before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Messages.
Frederic Demargne: Yes. And then we have notification.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: So what is the difference between notification and actions and the uh sorry and the tasks?
Ghiles Moussaoui: tasks is specific things that you have to do, right? So, we have to take action, right? Notification you can just see. For example, if the NDA is signed from both parties and now you have access to the signed NDA, you can see it. Okay, notifications. I got the NDA signed.
Frederic Demargne: a state of notifications they don't have to work they don't have to produce they are being informed yeah but I think I would put it in the tasks as well as completed actions or something like this okay so
Ghiles Moussaoui: You don't have to take any actions for it.
 
 
00:51:17
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: But for signing the NDA, you would have Yeah. Yes.
Frederic Demargne: when when when something here is notified to you that an NDA is completed um I suppose everything else progresses in the system logically right but I really want them to know task is their workload for them to click, for them to load s*** up. Notification is your Bloomberg. It's your popup. Whatever happens, it should be more here. It should be okay. I will think I just maybe there are a bit too many section on the on the left.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Um I understand. Okay. The tasks.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Um I think uh yeah I think data room should not I don't think data room should be a specific category like this I think it should be inside the active deals um I think reports makes sense calendar makes sense task for what you said can we go into data rooms oh s*** we don't see okay so here the the reasoning thing for me was investors know that they have clicked on an opportunity.
 
 
00:52:27
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think it would make more sense if there is data. I can switch to an account if there is data.
Frederic Demargne: They requested access. There's an NDA that's been already signed. They suddenly get a notification that now your access to OpenAI data room is live. I want them to go into the data room. I want them to see it and go and work and read documents, click documents. I want them to be able to inquire, ask questions, whatever. I want us to be able to monitor that the phase where they're in. So I think I understand. I think what I to do this I think I will go to dashboard. Yeah. And I will get I will have sort of a banner on the things that I want them to to be highlighted. The problem is the problem is because you want to go straight there. No, no, not necessarily. The dashboard again the dashboard is the eagle view. I want them to be able to find in the menu the workload, right?
 
 
00:53:33
 
Frederic Demargne: what what is it they must do? They must click, spend time on, upload, download, read, whatever, ask questions about. So here in this list, when they get a new data room, there'll be a notification. First of all, little blue blue number. They're going to click and maybe there are three data rooms, maybe there are four data rooms. They're going to see their active folders, be able to just like a Google Drive, be able to just go straight to it, focus on it. When you are when you are in the dashboard, for me, it's the overview. When you want to specifically log in back into the system to focus on just reviewing the data room that Julian just just opened up, they're going to click right there. They're going to go on any active deals and any ongoing deals. There may be multiple notifications about like this like we data room has just been uh open available for you. Yeah. Uh a subscription pack has been sent to you. Yes.
 
 
00:54:34
 
Frederic Demargne: Uh all sorts of notifications were added and and that's what we want to that's what we want to show here as as a as a counter as a as a as a counter growing to show okay this is all the all the new things that you have to that's the notifications for me. These are all messages that notify you that there's progress. You said before that notification and tasks are separate. So yes there could be new things which could be task or new thing which are notifications.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So,
Frederic Demargne: So they related at some point they should they should show that something new is happening on the active deals that you are you are currently considering as a user. So for me data room is something that should pop up like this as well. And then what you are saying is on top of that data room should also be a way to get back to the investment opportunity. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And to clear it. But if in the process of the data room I want people to be able to engage, ask questions, review documents and read them.
 
 
00:55:34
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: f*** you.
Frederic Demargne: But also to be able to say now my review is complete. I want them to be able to say I have reviewed the data room. I'm ready to proceed. That process we don't know what people do these days, right? And if they need to request a call, they request a call. It goes through the message board and all in the data room um there will need uh when we have folders in data rooms, we will need uh like an um a call for action, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Should I shall I shall I switch account and um show you where there is data so it makes more sense?
Frederic Demargne: Call to action. Yeah. Uh if you have one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, if you have one you can use it that'd be cool.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, great. Yeah, I've been testing with one. Um, so we do have some data in it.
Frederic Demargne: I think it's going to help us.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oops.
 
 
00:56:40
 
Frederic Demargne: In any case, that needs to be tested. See how users react, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. So, for now the dashboard looks like this. So when I I get to the dashboard I see directly featured opportunities only three out of let's say I have 11 C3 on the space X uh open AI and perplexity when I scroll down I see the outstanding tasks recent updates this is a stream of let's say news what happened in your portfolio maybe price changed or something like that uh actions uh so action center and so upcoming schedule close deal.
Frederic Demargne: So
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let's say SpaceX measure capital December 11 close and portfolio snapshots of okay I have these vehicles I have subscribed to three of them. Okay so this is the dashboard when I go to active deals this is basically how it would look like for the investor. This is all data mostly here. So you can see Space X venture capital opening apply anthropic.
Frederic Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So let's say you want to see um so you can see okay should I pause because there's couple information inside allocation minimum ticket maximum ticket unit price um your pipeline so if you have an active NDA you can
 
 
00:57:48
 
Frederic Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: be uh it will be seen here if data room is unlocked you will have label subscription approved you will have it here and there's also I am interested and view deals viewed So details. So when I go for example in view details this opens and it looks like okay deal overview there's a couple of information um so this for example let's say you don't want the investor to be seen I can remove it but basically description investment thesis and then there is a term sheet so it is not field but it is basically the same stuff as inside the document uh examples we Julian sent me.
Frederic Demargne: There's no
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And there is um frequently asked question. So I can add and delete frequently. So what is perplexity for now? Plexity is something. And then there is three other buttons. So there is basically update interest. Um this will generate an approval. There is access data room and ask a question. Um No. Uh this is done here in the data room.
 
 
00:59:10
 
Frederic Demargne: Now update update interest doesn't uh trigger an approval. Update interest triggers the issuance of a subscription pack.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I go to data rooms now I will see okay I do have access to perplexity. It is approved uh for SpaceX as well. When I go to perplexity I can see okay um ex so okay request extension if seven days like one day is remaining. If you want seven more days there is okay investment overview um investment thesis description a couple of other informations fee structure and then the data room documents which I can you know preview if I want there is a
Frederic Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: couple of documents I want to preview here I can download them um and then there is uh this submit the subscription
Frederic Demargne: If you if you if you review the term sheet and you're okay with the term sheet, you don't need to go through the data room. You can you can say, I want to invest 500,000 without reviewing the data room. Yeah. Yeah, we should we should realize it's true.
 
 
01:00:19
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: We may have clients who don't need to review the data top up who may just want to invest or maybe they've already invested so they they know the structure and they just want to top up.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: It's true that we should give the option as well to be in both to invest right away happen in my view it can happen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Through the active deal.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, actually it happens 30% of the time it happens. That's true for for me updating interest should be tri triggering uh the issuance of a subscription pack that the customer the investor reviews and decides to sign or not to sign the it's pretty much independent from accessing the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: room. uh but that if you want access that room then yes there is and it doesn't trigger u clicking on accessing that room does not trigger the validation it triggers the generation of the NDA the NDA is pre-signed by
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: us yeah sent to the investor for him to sign it yeah so we don't approve it we just automate Yeah.
 
 
01:01:20
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand. Yeah. So you mean okay if there is an active deal they see some details they don't want to see more so no need for data rooms they should be able to subscribe directly so submit a subscription or like a demand for a subscription pack is that correct okay I will make it happen um okay yes so this how did looks like uh I have to create another deal uh I don't know if you have time
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Okay. But data room sorry data room is not um data room is should be a hierarchy of of folders. Yeah it's underneath. So maybe scroll down hey let's please in the data room where you have deal documents. I think for me when when the perception I have of data room is hierarchy of folders where you have lots of different content. So you have a financials, correct?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Frederic Demargne: You might have a page deck, you might have a media. So that's what that's the first thing that I would expect an investor to see when he clicks on data room.
 
 
01:02:27
 
Frederic Demargne: So look, he has the term sheet is one thing. Yeah. So here documents, that's the data room content with the folders.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: Just in this one, there's one only, but yeah, there'll be multiple ones.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. All right. Sorry.
Frederic Demargne: Multiple
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I mean if for example this you want me to place it here or like instead of investment fees and all of that stuff I can put it here as well directly and yes so for now you can only see one folder but um so within this page which is the deal page of perplexity which is one I'm seeing I can go to documents and you can see okay there is one document I can upload multiple ones so okay I can change the data I can upload and I can put it Okay, this is the folders and they can put it. Okay, do you want the investor to be able to see it from the data room? You can click uh yes, which will basically make it as uh you know visible for them.
 
 
01:03:23
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it is upload feature and also link.
Frederic Demargne: I think I think the back end is okay. I think I think it's more on a user interface. I think here when you click on data room what you showed before for me it looks like an investment opportunity here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Right. So you have it look more like a series of folders.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, what needs to be changed specifically?
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it this? Should be go on the top or should I get rid of?
Frederic Demargne: I think the left side. Yeah, the left side with investment overview, investment terms, fee structure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Maybe all of this could be encapsulated in a folder itself which is the investment terms where that will be available the term sheet and like it's the term sheet basically elements and what is saying is visually there in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: that left side like you have the blue rectangle on the right side.
 
 
01:04:12
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Well, on the left side, you'd have a rectangle, maybe a gray one with 10 folders, which is uh the legal documents, the uh the the uh financial analysis or financial statements, maybe there's a presentation, etc., etc., etc.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Got it.
Frederic Demargne: But more like folders.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that works.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. You the way the way we had thought about this was um there is a standardization of the documentation the basic documentation which is a pitch deck which is um a term sheet which is uh if available a webinar an interview of a CEO that was I mean I think for me the the the first thing that you should see as can you know in in in Google that would be most relevant document or something like this. And then if the if the user wants to deep dive into the folder, then he has a hierarchy of folders. Yeah, we can do that. And then we could mark what files are the most important and they would come as favorites or most important documents and then if they want to do that, they can double click in the folders.
 
 
01:05:17
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, sure. Yeah. It could be for example a section of like 10 or like five most important documents and here when you upload the document you can I can add label okay this is part of those most important and it will
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, correct. Yeah, that' be good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: be seen there directly yeah got it yeah I can do that um okay So of course
Frederic Demargne: or like priority. It could be a degree of importance and maybe also priority. Okay. Okay. I see that the time is running so we don't need to go through I need to digest all of this and and to provide with with our feedback. Just one thing that was interesting to see is when you dispatch an investment opportunity to a user. So you are admin user. You are just you've just created a new investment opportunity and you dispatched it to a new to a new investor. So how how do you do that?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can go to uh so the deal page.
 
 
01:06:15
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I go to deals and then I can select the deal I want to uh go. So I go publicity let's say and here I can see okay overview term sheet interest data room inventory members members I can remove and remove and add or like invite members directly here. So I can remove uh so this is the admin cannot be removed but investor you can see I can remove him.
Frederic Demargne: Okay, here what is very important for us I don't know maybe you did it somewhere else is whenever you associate a user an investor you need automatically to associate the introducer attached to it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um so this Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So it needs to be done right away at this time because then we want to make sure that in the when we when we generate the reports that we are able automatically thanks to this association to know for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: each individual investment of a user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Frederic Demargne: It's associated to an investment opportunity with an amount of money they invested the the economics of this investment but it's also associated to introducers and that could be multiple ones.
 
 
01:07:22
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, yeah, yes, that works.
Frederic Demargne: So that's with their feed associated to it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So in the back end it is already connected uh but only through the introdu introductions or like introducers page. So here if there is a specific introduction in the process when the subscription is created automatically with the stage of spending it checks it identifies okay is the this deal is there any specific link between okay this investor this deal uh and the amount in basically this page. So in the data in the tables and if there is then it will link it.
Frederic Demargne: So when so where where so where do you uh um where do you uh inform the system that there is a link?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. It is in the database. So the system in the process it checks a database if there is a link right it checks okay the name um the name of the investor subscription ID. So it works with ids and if there is a link then it takes that because it uses it inside the fees right.
 
 
01:08:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So inside the feed yeah
Frederic Demargne: This I understand I understand. So a posterior so after the fact you know after the subscription the system check if there is a link and then does what you explained this my question is before the system check that there is a link somebody needs to see to to uh uh say that there is a link you create intro yeah but the intro is based on on a deal I Yeah, you you could select it on the deal, but I suppose you
Ghiles Moussaoui: so it's here uh you create an introduction. Yeah. So you select the Yeah. So you can select the deal and see
Frederic Demargne: could select it without the deal, right? Because sometimes people just introduce to us in general, they don't know what the investor wants to do. But the fees are different based on the deals. Yeah. But then that will come after. No. So the introduction, the commission is different deal by deal. Yes. But what you're mapping is the human relationship between a person who's an introducer and a person who's an investor.
 
 
01:09:34
 
Frederic Demargne: The the fees come after if there is a deal, if there is a closing on the deal, there are certain economics that are being negotiated and as you know they change all the time, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think um it could be a feature that okay, you want to um link both an introducer and an investor but you don't want to create an introduction so there is no fees no deal working I think
Frederic Demargne: Deal by deal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I I should add something in the investors yeah
Frederic Demargne: Not yet. A lot of people would introduce the platform without a deal yet. Yeah, exactly. Because now we have a platform. Before we didn't have a platform. So before we would specifically target a deal that we're running, but now we have a platform. So now we can say to people who are introducers just just throw everybody you work with, everybody you know, bring them to us. We will figure out what deal works after. But at least at least their contact base, their CRM is loaded.
 
 
01:10:36
 
Frederic Demargne: I think what is very important because I remember this is super critical when you design the database when we did before the data model each. So you create I mean you have a new deal for this new deal you need to generate a link between an investor where you decide to dispatch it to and introducer partners uh commercial partners lawyers I mean lawyers
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: no because lawyers is not linked to investor lawyers is linked to to an investment opportunity uh for us in in this system you can an investor or even anyone can link up a lawyer can link up no this
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: is I'm talking about from virtual perspective you can have your own lawyer as an investor because you want to your lawyer to be in copy of but here I'm talking about as an admin vers okay so what we need is to we need to make sure that for every when we dispatch a new deal for every single investor who receive the the deals that we want to make sure that everything is associated at this time it'll be the Nice.
 
 
01:11:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: So before that we need to have defined the term sheet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. And the fe um because otherwise you cannot associate the term sheet the fee model and the introducers. We will have so the system needs to help I suppose what be I suppose the fee model. Well that's a good question. the fee model. So the fees I want to apply to a deal before I propagate it to everyone.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, sorry.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. What we what we don't know is what the introducer is going to want to charge because often the introducer charges on top of what we offer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So there is you know default uh when I create an introduction there is okay commission rate I can choose there is a default commission rate when I create an introducer I can put okay default commission rate uh optional
Frederic Demargne: Tricky. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: so default commission and when I create an introduction I can put okay if I don't change anything it is a default if I change something then this one will be the you know the main thing that will be
 
 
01:12:42
 
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: taken into consideration Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: The problem the problem I don't think we're going to resolve it all now because there's a lot to take into account but the female will depend on the term sheet. So as an example, if there is no subscription fees, there will not be a commission on the subscription fee.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: Um, so it's it's it's it's all interrelated. you you cannot define a um by default uh introducer fee that could work for any deals because depending on the term sheet that you will have or not a subscription fee you will have or not a performance fee
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: or you will have or not a management fee.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: So I think from uh from Julian's perspective who is the one who's going to have to work on this the most at least in the beginning you need to think okay I'm going to now I'm going to start
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: selling openi so I for a particular series so I need to define what will be the term sheet for that in that series for this investment opportunity which is what I do and I define the the fees as well for us but then the introducers I tend to say to um plus fees.
 
 
01:14:08
 
Frederic Demargne: So I tend to say I have our fees, our term sheet and what I say to the introducers is whatever you wish to be paid, you have to inform me because that will come on top. That's what I do practically today. Yeah. So basically for me in my in my logic maybe I'm wrong before you before the introducer agree to introduce there should be some kind of agreement. Maybe not the final agreement usually has to be some kind of agreement whether it's part of the spread, it's part of a subscription fee, it's part of the performance fee or a combination of Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. So the idea is that there is a there is a fee model which is agreed. Maybe it could be modified. Okay. This you should have the flexibility to modify it. Modify it but there is already a fee model. Yeah. Associated to this term sheet. Yeah. When this fee model is associated to this term sheet, this is where you can associate an investor with an introducer.
 
 
01:15:02
 
Frederic Demargne: before that okay we should not be able to do that because then the system will not know for that particular deal for that investor associated to this time sheet how how does that work so I think there there is some logic that is missing uh to make sure that we associate things perfectly also you know the arranger will get the remaining of that commission so it's not only we need to there is a there is a a fee model for the arranger there is a theme for the partner potentially. Yeah. So I think here there is a bit more uh indepth review that we have to do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Okay. I understand. I thought um Okay. Introducing is something that comes on top. It's not associated to any of the fees in the term sheet or like the fee blends.
Frederic Demargne: No, the introduction itself not not necessarily but the fee model in is associated to so so how much the introducer will uh make as a commission is directly associated to a deal and a term sheet because one deal
 
 
01:15:55
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Frederic Demargne: multiple term sheets. Yeah. So you could have an open AI investment opportunity and Julian may will very well decide to have different term sheets for that open AI investment opportunity. Yeah. So here the in a data model we need to be super granular.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: So this is a transit which is a key.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah. In a data in a database to generate all of these models.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think there is also some new
Frederic Demargne: Okay. This we need to have a we need to have a specific reviews and maybe take maybe we will have to do a face tof face meeting at some point highest we need to define because maybe it will be more efficient. Yeah, whatever is efficient face to face or not but you need to try it try it with an example a real life example and then see how it goes. Yeah, I think I think if you I don't know if you have documented the data model, but I think I can also review that and let you know uh the change to be made comments.
 
 
01:17:02
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I will have um yeah, I will have diagrams and also all the database relationships and how it works uh you know links between tables and all and the processes and also schedules and stuff like that.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And also I think if you have time and um I'm fairly flexible, we can go on meetings if you don't understand something or you want to understand something specifically or I can also set up an agent that is
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, I guess the data model I can the relationship with between the databases I can I can do that easily.
Ghiles Moussaoui: connected to the code and it explains to you everything as well. But okay, yeah, understood.
Frederic Demargne: I'm I built it for the before so I'm I'm used to that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Frederic Demargne: I think we need to add there's a couple of things that we need to cross check as as a basis to make sure that the logic is there. Yeah. And then we need to work based on what you've done and see how we can improve.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Frederic Demargne: Uh but I think it's already a lot there's already a lot here. So I think I think it's more the logic is is more maybe what maybe what is missing is some of the logic but the the overall architecture I think is fine.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Great.
Frederic Demargne: I think it's good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, there is a couple of other stuff. Um, but I guess we will have to get to it. Um, you know, one great.
Frederic Demargne: Yeah, I think it should be okay for now. It's okay for now. No, no, it's fantastic. Thank you, Ellis. It's amazing. Thank you for spending the time.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Frederic Demargne: That gives Fred a very good overview of what's going on. And then we just need to start work basically from Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Got it. Yep. Thanks.
Frederic Demargne: Amazing. Thank you again so much. Yeah.
