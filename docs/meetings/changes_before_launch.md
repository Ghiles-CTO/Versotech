Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me start transcribing the meeting.
Julien Machot: Oh yeah, thank you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, yes.
Julien Machot: Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, okay. Yeah, I think it's better to do it in a separate platform just because we can add as much uh stuff as we want. You know, we can create it without having some kind of overlapping elements um through the platforms. Yeah. And um another thing is do you think the SAS model is different or if we create let's say SAS but general version right um that suits all of the personas that you want to roll it to and then
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um once you get for example a customer for it they say they're interested we give them um an overview a demo and everything and they want something specific for them let's say the features are not covering all of their workflows. So we can do what we can do is offer them also custom stuff for okay they can give us what they need and we can create a snapshot edited for them specifically and that could be an upsell.
 
 
00:01:07
 
Julien Machot: Yes. Uh, absolutely. I'm I'm with you on this. Absolutely. So basically the computer model is upselling with options with unlocking tiers different tiers but in the same time being able to customize based on what they need and that's going to that should make so basically what it should be is technology as a service right so as we grow the client will have certain requests and then we want to be able to develop for them with your skills we can develop for them particular modules that will help them increase the power of their platform and this is how we will retain the clients.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: It will be customized for them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, it's pretty cool actually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I think um that is the best use case for technology that creates itself very quickly uh recently.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah. So like the main I believe myself that the main thing would be um the basically okay what is the problem that the basically platform will solve for the clients right and then uh lean on that to solve the
 
 
00:02:25
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: problem and then go uh basically niche. So every time we get a customer, we can customize it for them, right? And it would um very good.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Absolutely.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Can I go through the platform you think?
Julien Machot: Uh yes, just one second. Um one more comment regarding the access to the verso platform. So um I believe there should be two ways to access it. Uh we should have uh direct access like when people type verse.com so through the com but they also can find the link at the top of versholdings.com right login.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um okay.
Julien Machot: So the tool will redirect to to the content uh uh the the same the same you have here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So yeah. Um do you want nobody to have access to the staff portal right only internally in the I remember sorry. Yeah.
Julien Machot: I think um maybe maybe what we could do um what we could do here um we could we could smartly hide the button staff access maybe just leave it for investors just a login um
 
 
00:03:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Julien Machot: and uh um what we could do for the for the staff access um what we could do is uh yeah, just a link or just a just a symbol.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Just a link. Um Yes.
Julien Machot: Maybe a little symbol like a like a lock. A little symbol like a lock and when you click on it um Yeah, like this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Like this.
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And when you click on it, what happens now?
Julien Machot: Um.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It just goes in the login.
Julien Machot: Uh.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I mean yeah
Julien Machot: Oh. Oh, wait. Uh, wait. I know. I know. I know. Sorry. I I'm trying to make clear my mind. Um, no. Yeah, we we don't need that button there anywhere. Uh, it's just going to be the login. The login is for investors but we uh the staff what we will do is versotch.com-admin and then it gives us uh access to the login for the staff.
 
 
00:04:50
 
Julien Machot: That's it. But it doesn't appear on this screen. There's no need.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay Got it. Yeah, I will I will remove it. Um, so yeah, for now when you go to investors it go to verso holdings dash login. This is just a name. You can change it to verso tech if you want investor and when you go to stuff it goes to verso tech um dash login because if you remember in the beginning we had a meeting and uh you said
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay so we can go to verso um holdings yeah.com and so basically the investor will have uh a login here directly login button and when they click on
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah. Holdings. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it they arrive here right right without this back to home button so there is nowhere to to go back and they can sign in directly here and it goes uh forward and I believe we can make it so
 
 
00:05:45
 
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's correct. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that this uh landing page we can customize it for the future uh bas basically portal for um more investors and it could be also something in versa holdings with another button or like um services or like SAS uh
Julien Machot: Yep. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: concluder or something like that and we can have landing page for it and all in there like the staff access would be to their uh portal where they manage their um entities investment and all of that and the
Julien Machot: So I think uh I think this page that you see now will be um will be the concluder.com landing page and the staff and the staff button.
Ghiles Moussaoui: investor would be Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's basically what I wanted to say.
Julien Machot: We'll do the same strategy. We'll get rid of it and we'll just ask conclud.com-admin and that's where people will access directly when they work in the team.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: That's how we're going to do it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure. Yes.
 
 
00:07:02
 
Julien Machot: Yeah, it's easier.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I agree. I think it's a good idea. Yeah. Okay. Um, let me then go back to here.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, this is the dashboard of the investor. I changed some stuff.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I made a little bit of UI changes. I added for example small things like um u profile pictures for the deals and entities.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So let's say we have here I tested it with open AI in anthropic and yeah so okay this is the page.
Julien Machot: Very nice. Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if I go back um here yeah so okay so this is dashboard I can go through it. There is first uh this section which is some kind of a header um a couple of information and then this is featured opportunities.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is the stuff I have um open. So the active deals I have open. And then if I go down there is action center where I have out sending tasks, recent updates.
 
 
00:08:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So recent updates meaning okay if I have some new interest if I have done something through the platform it will be seen here.
Julien Machot: Uh-huh.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And this is also an action center and this is upcoming schedule.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um and this yep and this is portfolio snapshot.
Julien Machot: Super cool.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I go and click here it goes to the portfolio page and below is okay deal room uh of market opportunities.
Julien Machot: And did you Yeah. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is not yet implemented. Request position statement. It is in the reports and custom analytics request also um in the reports. This is basically the dashboard minimalistic. It is mostly uh here as I thought about yeah I thought about adding some kind of section where it is basically market sentiment or something like that of maybe private equity or like your entities that okay scrapes the
Julien Machot: It's super cool. Mhm. Yeah. Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: web and updates itself each week uh that says okay for example recent news Nvidia earnings um what's what is the the impact on AI or something like had presented nicely, but it's just an idea I had.
 
 
00:09:24
 
Julien Machot: Yeah, absolutely.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Maybe we can map it out later. Um, yeah.
Julien Machot: Um what you could have is um equivalent to a Bloomberg. You could have a feed of news feed for finance.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Like um feed of news and the market.
Julien Machot: News feeds for finance. Um sometimes online you can find news feed that are free. You just have to create a band and the news keep going.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: They keep scrolling or they keep coming on the Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Yeah. I mean, we can link it to directly um we can script Bloomberg. We can script also um Yahoo Finance. um CNBC I think is a good one for finance but yeah I mean um this idea I had we can map it out okay so the profile of the investor this is how it is um basically right now
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay so there's some kind of profile picture they can put this basic information so the email uh display name job u title security they can change their password here.
 
 
00:10:37
 
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh there is a preferences thing just for messaging and stuff. There is also KYC information which is okay information.
Julien Machot: Oh, nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So this is um from a questionnaire right? So they can answer directly here um to basically profile them. uh and the the way it works this so how this works is first when the user sign in they have to finish an onboarding right the onboarding um will be done through okay uh a notice will be sent
Julien Machot: Yes. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to the dashboard they click on it they go to tasks right in the tasks there is on boarding uh task they click on it goes here for the KYC and onboarding and this is tracked as well so we know when the um onboarding is done and also uh KYC is verified and done for the investor and yeah so yes yes yes so it's not one time you have
Julien Machot: Yeah. And they can save, they can start and save and go back later, the next day or whatever, right?
 
 
00:11:55
 
Julien Machot: It's fine, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: to do everything but okay it's like something for example to be able to have active deals you have to provide us a couple of information maybe you can also see it from the verse tech staff portal.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, you can see this guy doesn't have KYC active. So they have uh to do it but yeah so yeah there is um compliance questionnaire and then supporting documents.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you have um basically the documents uh government ID and all of that. Um I think another question
Julien Machot: So, we need to make uh the there's some of these uh documents that we need to make compulsory. So you suggested some documents at the bottom like government ID or passport, proof of address. This um this has to be uh compulsory right in the system. Um so uh let me give you um uh let me let me send it to you now by just by email so it's easier for you. I'm going to send you K KYC list.
 
 
00:13:06
 
Julien Machot: These are the basic uh compulsory uh documents. Compulsory KYC documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So they're required.
Julien Machot: Yeah, we we need them. Yeah, we need to have them for all the accounts regardless of uh whatever happens.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Um so let me send you the email now because I've got a full list. And so there is four entities and then there is four people for individual uh individual directors and members.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Um so um shareholders and members.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh let me send you Okay, let me send you now. Okay, this is really like really specific list. Uh we we we have to have um are you okay with um the idea that we'll have an agent who is like our compliance agents who will be regularly checking the compliance right by itself and contacting contacting by itself the um account user and making sure we have updated documents you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay. Yeah. So for now when I go to KYC a click upload document there is this popup app upload KYC and then there is custom there is big statement so custom stuff and then you put the label that you want right uh that what is basically the label trust agreement or like ID something like that and then you put the expire expiry date here Right.
 
 
00:14:57
 
Julien Machot: Okay, nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And this this can be used directly.
Julien Machot: Okay, nice. Sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We can do as well you said is okay an agent that analyzes the document. Right. So it renders a document, it analyzes it and then uh reports back some kind of a schedule thing that works.
Julien Machot: That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So which one do you think uh is better? Do you think you want
Julien Machot: I I think in the for for now I mean it would be better if we have an agent that scrapes the document verifies it and then u confirms if the information is correct or not. I think it's still good to have it there as an expiry date but then I wouldn't um make it optional. I would make it uh if it yeah required.
Ghiles Moussaoui: required.
Julien Machot: Uh even though arguably arguably some documents may not be may not have like an expiration.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Julien Machot: Um, okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I think you can leave it like this, but it would be good to have an agent that's going to verify everything people are doing because what we don't want is imagine a thousand people typing wrong information.
 
 
00:16:21
 
Julien Machot: Oh my god, we're going to have such a headache after, you know, we need to because it's compliance and legal stuff, we need to have like 100% certainty and verification.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: And if something is not quite right, there's a notification that should go directly to my team and someone in my team will have a job to verify. If indeed we verify and it is an error, we need to requ the agent need to request automatically to the uh to the client to make the amendment required.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I Yeah, I think there was KYC uh review page. Um I included KYC review page.
Julien Machot: Yes, exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, got it. Understood for the KYC. But yeah, so so far this is how I done it. I think I will add the uh so the list I know about this. I think I implemented it because you sent it to me via WhatsApp, right?
Julien Machot: Yes. Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh you Yes.
Julien Machot: That's right. I'm sure I did.
 
 
00:17:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I do believe this is um um wait one second. Let me check documents. I believe um so compliance always you also sent me the questionnaires which are okay compliance questioner versus capital SVP vehicle rangers versus holdings limited.
Julien Machot: Yeah, this one is a lengthy questionnaire um which may be modified uh from time to time based on the laws and regulations.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah.
Julien Machot: So, but for now it's a fairly long questionnaire already. Um, you can try to when you have time to try to put into uh a specific compliance page. Um, it's going to give us additional information about the clients.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Should I put it also? Is it the KYC or is it just preferences?
Julien Machot: So, so the way you have to look at this, it's the for me the KYC for me the KYC is like the bunch of documents to know who the client is.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: KYC know your client, know your customer. So, it's just documents and tick the box on the documents.
 
 
00:19:01
 
Julien Machot: This one, it's sort of declarative. In other words, we ask questions like an interview or like uh an investigation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There you go.
Julien Machot: We ask questions to the customer to the client and the client ticks tick ticks signs and approves and it comes to us for compliance purposes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: It's just in case if one day we have a legal problem or if we have um compliance problem, it's not us who said something about the client, is the client himself who signed it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, go ahead.
Julien Machot: It's to protect us basically. But I think this one can be um and you can make it a specific module like a specific part like a specific tool because um because okay we will launch with this one but in the future depending on the client nationality or place of residence they will have maybe 20 different questionnaires with with nuances with differences because the the the world of compliance is becoming really more and more and more complicated, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So, this is just to start.
 
 
00:20:25
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. Yeah. I mean I can put it in preferences for example or something like that. Um for my logic is that okay it is a questionnaire uh and given the answers you know the client better so it makes sense to put it in the KYC it's like know your clients and then when they answer all of that it's also part of that or I think if we can just put it in preferences or some other page in the profile maybe compliance right we can add compliance thing where they can go in
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: there uh they click on that they fill the information once it is done, they can click on sign, they can sign it. That will render a PDF for them and they will have it also inside their documents. I think that makes sense.
Julien Machot: I actually actually actually when I look at this page now where you have KYC and on boarding as a label on the little gray gray uh banner then you have KYC verification so people uh will uh put I think it's more it's I think it's more KYC information more than verification.
 
 
00:21:33
 
Julien Machot: I think it's KYC information and then I I see what you're saying. with submit an application which is fine. I I think at the bottom where you have general information supporting documents I think there you can create one section which is going to be compliance questionnaire or investor questionnaire.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. So, it should remove this. There's also some unders.
Julien Machot: Um, uh, yeah, that one. Yeah, that's right. That that title, you don't need to to to have it there in particular, but below you're going to have a section. Yes. And in that section, you're going to have like start your questionnaire, maybe a button, and then that starts a new form, something like that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. I understand. Um, all right. I will do that.
Julien Machot: Okay. Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem. Yeah. Okay. So this is the profile. So in the profile you can go to entities right. In entities um here I can create a new entity right.
 
 
00:22:33
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is basically a third party um company like for example a trust.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You told me last time this will be used to be invested through. Right. So when you go to dealer room you can submit um a subscription and um basically subscription is uh you know you have to go uh through either individual or the or entity when you have entity you have to
Julien Machot: Uh yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: create one or if you already have one registered for example I have vers management LTD I can use that right so KYC is pending Yes.
Julien Machot: Yes. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I think you're right. So when there is an opportunity like Revolute, you'll click on Revolute, you read everything, you're happy with the data room, then you're going to say, "Okay, I want to subscribe. I want to invest." So you'll click u I'm interested. Then you'll click how much you want like $1 million into revenue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: And then it will tell you how do you wish to invest personally.
 
 
00:23:38
 
Julien Machot: So the account will be my account personally or here it's you. So it's your personal account or it will say virtual management and then you can click virtual management if you decide that it's a structure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And then KYC document. Um I can click on view or like edit. Uh here I forgot to add the button but and when you click on view you can see entity details and also here we see document where you can upload similarly with that form.
Julien Machot: Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh but yeah because said entities. So, is it the same?
Julien Machot: Yeah, it's the same.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, I Okay.
Julien Machot: It's going to be the same list. But you look um the the way you need to look at it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Or is it?
Julien Machot: Uh if you go to the KYC list, let me explain something because it's important.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So I divided this in two parts, right? Four entities. So that will give you the documents of the company.
 
 
00:24:31
 
Julien Machot: But when you look when you look into the list of entities four entities there is register of members register of directors and then we say the ID for each member and director but then when you look below it says about individuals. So basically if you have an entity with five directors and one member you're going to have six humans, six people and so then people have to go yeah they have to go below four individuals and they have to
Ghiles Moussaoui: All of this.
Julien Machot: give their copy of passport and copy of ID. So that's how that works basically.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.
Julien Machot: Yeah, it's obviously easier if you invest personally because it's faster.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: You give a copy of passport and utility bill finished.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Finished.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um what we need also is people to type their full address. This is actually very important uh in the profile. I think uh we need yeah we need a full uh residential address for the person and for the entities we need a full address for entities.
 
 
00:25:35
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: here. Okay. For both for both investors and entities here, I think it is.
Julien Machot: Yeah, here you have it for entities and for the person, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. It's not required.
Julien Machot: We we need to have it. Absolutely. Because remember this address will go into the contract.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So we need to have it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. Understood.
Julien Machot: And for individual, so on your own personal accounts, we also need those fields with the address, the city, the country. Because if you say I will invest myself I do a ticket personally then you need your full address that the system will will will take it as it is. Uh also we need uh in the uh profile we need also your phone number. We have to have your phone number. So we need to have your mobile and we need to have your office or home number.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, got it. Now I'm thinking about it that you said okay the address would be taken in here.
 
 
00:26:48
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um uh okay so let's say I have the address right and I go to the data room let's say I'm an individual or an entity it does not matter because the address will be still registered on the investor
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: level right and yeah but sorry yeah so there is entities which are directly investors there is entities that are third parties that are linked to the investor or individual,
Julien Machot: Um but these addresses will be different usually, right? So what I'm saying? Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? Investor as well.
Julien Machot: Yes. That's right. That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And when you submit a deal commitment, right? Um a submission of a subscription through the deal data room then um there it is um okay you select okay entity or individual. If it is entity, if it is you already, right?
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you are an entity and you're signing through there directly, then it would use your information which means your address, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you are using another client's not like another entity or like a trust or something like that that you have created here, then it would use the address of that entity, right?
 
 
00:28:02
 
Julien Machot: That's right. 100%.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is that how it works? Okay, understood.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, is that rendered in subscription pack or the NDA?
Julien Machot: No. Uh yes, it's always in NDA and in subscription packs and any other form of official letter that we have to write legal compliance uh financial reports uh quarterly
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: or annual reports. we will always use the same address for the given entity or for the person.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Now if you click on the profile uh the gray profile button here we need the full address for the person and we need the phone numbers home- office and mobile.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yeah. Got it.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um is there do you see it um how possible is it to have an entity that invites multiple users? Let's say each user comes to the platform as you said here for the for example let's say the entity is some bank and they have multiple registered members and directors and they all sign in inside the platform and
 
 
00:29:12
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: they all put those documents on entity level and also on their personal level.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So they have multiple users right so all of the users contribute to one entity which is the investors.
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh so as an investor they all contribute to they all are part of one entity right?
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yes. Actually, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Correct.
Julien Machot: So actually um um in um in this particular model for verse tech um we never really discussed this. I it invers either real is a person who invests so it's simple it's just an individual investor or real possesses a company called uh ABC corporation and so you click ABC corporation it's your company you invest for it
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: but what you just said is actually true you have sometimes uh a manager he has a company called uh XY Z and he's going to in he's going to invite Ples Julian Fred to invest together and come up uh but um in our system here in Verso I will not see that I will not see behind the company XY Z corp I will not see that there's reles I will not see that there's Julian I will not see anything.
 
 
00:31:05
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean in verse you would see.
Julien Machot: Well, I mean if people what I mean is there is a company XY Z which has an account with me but technically this company will invest 1 million.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I don't know if within the one million real did 250 Julian did 250 Fred did 500 I don't know but this is actually uh this is a particular um a particular module
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.
Julien Machot: that we should develop at some point because this is a syndication. So basically okay um let let me let me say it this way. If we have a bank working with us and the bank says I have 20 investors to invite inside my bank inside my my uh SPV or my entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay.
Julien Machot: Do we do we give a module to the bank to do the syndication? Do we give them an option to invite other accounts and then there's an invitation sent to the user and then the user can accept or reject.
 
 
00:32:25
 
Julien Machot: Is that something you want to do? What do you think?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so the way I understood it is you can also have investors linked to other investors, right?
Julien Machot: Correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So an investor can invite another investor through a user invite which will create an investor level on Verso Tech. So you can see them as investors. You can see them as linked as well on a specific deal or subscription, right?
Julien Machot: Yes, that's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And um and yes so each investor some of them could have for example you profile some of them would not. Uh when you submit um a subscription right as one investor you can select okay I want to do it through multiple investors. So it will be split between let's say four individuals maybe entities maybe a mix of individual entities. But if you click that you have to put it as um like you have to have investors as well. So I believe there should be partners a tab called partners somewhere here where we click on it where you click on it.
 
 
00:33:37
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This will create some kind of um yeah so there will be a form that you would enter for example the basic information the email that we would use for inviting users and all.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: When you submit it it would create an approval in the approvals page um in the verse that the staff person can go there they can see it they can confirm it.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Once I confirm it, investor profiles will be created automatically as partners, right?
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And then also the users as are invited. This then will create a notification for the um investor that submitted this form that okay this has been done. You can submit now a subscription selecting those investors partners that you want. I think that makes sense.
Julien Machot: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.
Ghiles Moussaoui: That's what I understand. If I'm wrong, please.
Julien Machot: It's a syndication. No, I think you're right. It's a syndication. So we're basically saying that anyone okay let's say now you have your account in front of us here on the screen you could you could actually yourself click on it create a new entity by yourself like because you decided this weekend this is what you want to do.
 
 
00:35:02
 
Julien Machot: So you could create your own entity and then you could invite uh 100 friends and you can do it by entering their email addresses because maybe they are not in Verso yet but you're going to invite them to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: join or they are already inside Verso.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So it's easier because they have an account and you do it account to account and invite them. That's pretty powerful actually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes, it is. It's like some kind of linked uh a linked uh how do I say investment?
Julien Machot: It's a it's a co it's a co- investment. So it's like linked networking like it's a network of investors and basically uh when when I create my my uh versal vehicle and I invite all my clients to come into Revolute.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: That's exactly what I do. Exactly. That's what I do. But I'm the administrator. So you're going to say oh because it's the business I'm in but to give that functionality to yourself now when you have your own personal account only but finally we give you that possibility to do it as well.
 
 
00:36:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: That's pretty cool.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. It's um it gives also the ability uh to the investor to use a platform more you know so they have things to do not just for
Julien Machot: Yeah. And increase the number of uh users who will come to us because then we can work with so many so many people. The only thing though um obviously as always we are the administrator. We are the people who must confirm that we approve the entities and we approve the new users every time.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Of course.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. That is done through right now approvals page. So it turns out to be very useful.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um now it's set for for like expanding.
Julien Machot: Amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, let's continue then so we can cover some ground. So okay, when I go to active deals, this is how it looks. There's some okay subscription in uh review. There is active NDAs, there is pending interest, there is open deals.
 
 
00:37:26
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: When I go below, this is dummy data created before. But basically for anthropic for example and open AAI, I created this And uh you can see like how it looks. So allocation is basically how much I think he invested and um mini ticket, maximum ticket, unit price. This is how it looks on the outside. There is uh profile pictures as well.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And if I go to details, this is how it looks. Um so there's new website that goes to entropic.
Julien Machot: Nice. Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um there is okay description investment thesis sector location um
Julien Machot: Um when when you click on any any link or any button that would that would trigger a third party website uh needs to always be a separate page. Always. We want to make sure people keep their login in our page and they are a new page opens when they come out every time you have a click or a link of the sort.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is correct.
 
 
00:38:39
 
Julien Machot: This is correct. Yeah, perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Great. Yeah, I understand. Yeah. And then when you um scroll there is still timeline. Uh there is term sheet. Uh you can see information of the term sheet here.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Not much uh information. Um and there is also frequent frequently asked questions.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah so frequently asked questions I added one let's see what do entropies do I added this so you can edit it from the page there's access doom there's ask a question there's I am interested there's I am
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: interested um we create basically okay I'm not sure if it would work because I tested it and I approved it but let's test it once we go to verse It will be um okay interest submitted.
Julien Machot: Yep. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Great. So this is how it looks. This is basically active deals, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um portfolio uh portfolio is okay.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
 
 
00:39:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: A couple of analytics. This is all for active deals and um yeah.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So performance metrics, portfolio allocation. There's not much u breakdown here because it's not active.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is well cash flow history. There is no cash flow history. Uh Verso fund this is all dummy data but they added for big and open AI. Um thing is there is no um it's it's pending.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for one it is pending for the other one it is.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you see committed because I signed the subscription agreement here it's uh pending. But yeah, if I go to um details, okay, I have position uh there is no position right now because position is created only after subscription is turned into active. Uh there's cash flow, performance, uh performance, evaluation and all of that you can create from the vehicles page.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And here's our documents.
Julien Machot: Nice steps.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So um I think I added a preview page where when you click on a document it opens directly the document and yeah another thing is I will get to it later for signatures right for verso sign uh we
 
 
00:40:54
 
Julien Machot: Yep. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: have to identify specifically where the signing happens like yeah so yeah for each local Yes.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Uh yes, that's right. So here here for example in the party B is usually me. Party A is usually the client.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I have to identify the pixel place where it is and let's say leave the last page always in the NDA as hardcoded to this and then we put the signatures years after it is signed.
Julien Machot: Okay. Okay. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Understood. Very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And uh that would happen also for other subscription types. But yeah, so this is how holdings look like. Uh now I can go to the data room. So data room I have enthropic and open AI tested web. The open AI has I think documents entropic doesn't. Okay. So it says subscription approved because I was testing with it.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay.
Julien Machot: Amazing.
 
 
00:42:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So there is request extension here which basically because if you remember you told me okay only seven days access right so you can see three days remaining when I put request extension it requests it um for one more
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: week um but it I have to go to the approvals page I can approve from there and then it goes ahead right yeah and yes so basically Here I can go below there is uh investment over overview um
Julien Machot: Okay. Very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: investment term fee structure and legal documents.
Julien Machot: Yep. Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is an um any um na template. So I added um a mix of okay documents that are inside the platform or documents that are in Google Drive that you want to see directly there.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you click on view it goes to Google Drive. Uh you have to submit.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh okay. Can access item. I don't forgot.
Julien Machot: There's something. Yeah.
 
 
00:43:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And um yeah. So here for all our documents you can see it directly here. Um okay this is how document looks and
Julien Machot: Okay. But do you agree do you agree with me that um Do you agree with me that a term uh a term when a user clicks wait um deal documents are they always going to be linking to Google Drive or do or or in the near future there sort of would be Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: No. Um so for now this this view when there is only view button this goes to Google drive. I have access denied so I cannot see the document but uh this preview and uh download this is basically a document inside the platform already.
Julien Machot: okay. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Right. So when I click yeah when I click on preview this loads and I can see the document here which means it is inside the platform and I can download it from
Julien Machot: Inside the breath. Yeah. And this yes so so you agree with me that as an admin I would have created a data room myself inside the platform and then basically that's where it connects with this this uh window.
 
 
00:44:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Okay. Okay. It's you know it's clear. Yeah it makes sense.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And it's also done automatically like uh giving access to the investor is done automatically through if you for example NDA is signed from both parties you know it is signed then it uh gives data room access automatically.
Julien Machot: All right. Yes, exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah and then below yeah below there is open AI uh like frequently FAQ uh for now this is how it is. I wanted to show you this but I tested it. I think I have to um kill the submission. I can do it.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay, let's go to verse and I can show you a bit more and then we can do this.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I have to envy how data room looks, right?
Julien Machot: Okay. Sure. Okay. Very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you have um days left and as well I've tested it.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So subscription is submitted.
 
 
00:45:40
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um data thesis and all of that is done. I did not add documents and then there is couple of uh other you know pages there is okay calendar there is reports in the reports you also have the documents um here. So for example you have couple of documents in the report you have couple of NDAs. Oh this is not visible. I have to change this but you can see uh stuff here and yeah so tests and yeah okay so and the rest I do not change much messages I changed a little bit of the UI but it's still
Julien Machot: Mhm. Nice. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the same but yeah so yeah you have profile pictures now I put my profile picture everywhere and Yep.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Oh, very nice. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is staff ed. Okay. So this is the first view of stuff and yeah.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is basically dashboard that I edited uh a little bit um so yeah there's compliance rate active deals pending KYC active LPS uh there is revenue um and fees there's new subscription
 
 
00:47:05
 
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um yeah and all this is capital commitment this is basically recent information ledger and operation center.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is this is basically a um action center, quick actions, new deal, a lot of other stuff. But yeah, so I can go to messages UI is improved. Uh but it's basically the same. I can start a conversation, start a group and it will create it with the investor. here approvals. Um so approvals for example I submitted a deal interest I put 900 and yeah so it looks like this deal interest business uh ventures LLC. So it is an um an entity right so um then when I click on it I can see more information if I wish to.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is okay the deal is anthropic uh say this is open um information so type of okay this is individual for example request details um reference information approve ID uh entity ID so yeah this is more
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: information you can message it from here so assigned from review and the review u data this is in case You can approve it or reject it.
 
 
00:48:41
 
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: When I click on approve um this running be approved and uh it's not approved.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. It's approved and okay.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is approved and when I go to deals I can see okay the deals I created lastly were open AAI and anthropic um let's say I go to anthropic yes so anthropic level I have
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: couple of information directly in the overview page which are you can see the information financial terms timeline uh deal over overview and then you can go to term sheet.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can edit term sheet in a publisher. You can create versions of it. Term sheet and fee plans are synchronized. Meaning if you create a term sheet to add investment fees to say the percent of um fees for management, subscription, car insurance and all that are also registered under fee plans.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We can see here um otherwise term sheet has more information and then there is interest. So um for example right now um I submitted this interest right I'm interested I approved it and then uh 900 so it is registered here for subscription submission before I yesterday so not yesterday before yesterday on 22th of
 
 
00:50:10
 
Julien Machot: Mhm. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: November I did that got approved so it was registered here as well I can go to data room here data room right you can revoke access you can extend access you can have the documents as well here.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can remove the documents, you can edit the documents.
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh you can put external link as the Google drive as I said or you can upload it.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so you can see you can choose okay link or this and then you can upload from internally as well. uh data room data due diligence uh and yeah okay so data room inventory uh it's stuff it's in inven so it's uh the inventory information that you can create can edit uh yeah so this is inventory
Julien Machot: Yes, there it is. Mhm. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: there's members um so you can see okay this is the super admin this is the person I have invited to the deal that have access to the open deal directly. There is fee uh plans I showed you there is subscription this subscription um so basically subscription is approved it creates a subscription record when I click on it it opens a tab of the subscription so yeah subscription looks
 
 
00:51:42
 
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: like this so you can edit it uh there is all of the information subscription number effective date funding due date not yet individual okay so in investment information vehicle information capital summary.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So nothing really happened. performance um as well and then capital calls here in capital calls cash flow distributions you can create stuff right so you can um edit it yourself which is cool um and then you have documents in the documents uh
Julien Machot: Okay, nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay the I will get back to it uh I think it's better but yeah so subscriptions will be seen here and then if I go to documents that are outside versus um how do I say the data room
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: because to a deal you want to have okay documents that are part of data room documents that are not part of the data room so when you upload documents here they will not be part of the data room
Julien Machot: Okay. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um FAQ so FAQ you can add FAQs you can remove stuff this will be seen in the data room and then there is activity that is basically uh registered as for now for example I clicked I'm interested the activity is registered here so this is basically uh how deals are and yeah so entities so entities is basically the same
 
 
00:53:12
 
Julien Machot: Okay. Excellent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: let me go to 215 this is entropic yeah so if I Go to view. Uh yeah. So there's this profile picture here. There's meta data. So just overview um where where you can edit here.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, platform, entity, entropic name, uh registration, legal, domicil, information date, required reporting, company plus online and all of that.
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh investors. So this is basically the investors that are linked to it. So you can see it here. I did uh commit yesterday uh before yesterday. So 22 and so it worked and then the documents.
Julien Machot: Very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So documents you can have them here directly and um yes so project it is basically all linked together and if I go to stakeholders yeah for now I did not test it but I added the
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: ability to okay add stakeholders or like type of um legal council accountant auditor administrator shareholder or Um yeah, so directors as well.
Julien Machot: Exactly.
 
 
00:54:40
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can invite people that are already in. You can also uh register new ones where you could put the information and then send them an invite.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Deals. So there's one deal open with this entity.
Julien Machot: And sorry uh sorry to go back for these stakeholders. um uh arguably they're going to have an account as well, right? It's not just that they're invited to view something.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, okay.
Julien Machot: We do we want them to have an account and that account um uh that account is potentially they could be investors themselves by the way. It's possible. Uh but that that account will be more like a service provider partner or stakeholder account. So maybe there will be in the future certain certain module we we create for them. So I'll give you an example. Uh uh the the the the law firm the law firms I work with in Luxembourg, UK, US. Um if we had an account for the lawyer and we have there a place where he can make introductions, he can present other clients.
 
 
00:55:57
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: he has to us. That'd be pretty cool actually. It would help us market our business. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Okay. Understood. Um Okay. So, you would like to be able to give them access to um the platform to Verse most likely, right?
Julien Machot: Yeah. To attack and my lawyer, Mr. Dupont is involved with us, you know, on on so many so many aspects.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Uh for him as our lawyer, it's good because he he he will also have access to all the legal work that we're asking him to do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh so we'll need to think about this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: But yeah. Yeah, that's probably very helpful.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And when it comes to health, if you remember, so uh entity health where it monitors what happens which means okay what do you have do you have all of the information for example legal jurisdiction is missing um stakeholder coverage there is no stakeholder also director status there is nothing document required there's still a few required and active deals total active on total deal but none are active u but yeah so and then activity log there is activity of recent activity and evaluation.
 
 
00:57:26
 
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So evaluation is what is it worth? So we can create stuff new evaluation total NAV and now per unit and yeah so this is basically entity if I go to investors basically the same
Julien Machot: Yeah. Just an idea uh just a thought uh somewhere somewhere in the system. Do you have a a place for the general log like the log of all of the clicks and activities of the platform? The general log. It's in Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, this supposed to be in audit. I'm not I don't see it is fully done because every time I add something new, it has to be also streamed here, right?
Julien Machot: In order. Okay. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, it's like the dashboard.
Julien Machot: Oh, yeah. That's true. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: better to build everything and then have the thing on top.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But yeah, so in here you would be able to see everything that um is happening.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But okay, so going back to investors um let's say I'm searching for the one I tested with um yeah I think it's this one.
 
 
00:58:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So here you can see um informations of user. You can see the deals that are they are part of. This is entropic. This is open AI 2065. Um you can add users. You can see below I do have user uh with myself.
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um activity timeline. This is not implemented. and add add user. So here you can basically select the user that already is signed inside the platform or you can send an invitation.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So send an invitation per email that was sent directly user invitation.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: U manage subscriptions. Oh oops I think I shouldn't have done that. Yeah, investment management. Um but yeah so edit you can edit the information and then at user yeah that's basically it in the users page and in the investors page I think for example for what we discussed of okay partners we're going
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to have here okay linked partners linked to what and to which subscription I think that could be helpful and this is subscriptions page um Yeah.
 
 
01:00:01
 
Julien Machot: Mhm. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So subscriptions page is so it's mostly this is just an overview of okay this is subscriptions there is a table that you can select here how many rows you want to see you can select per row and then
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um okay so for example if you want to go to a specific one you can go here uh you can go see the subscription where you can see the details I think We went through it here and so
Julien Machot: Yeah, very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: capital documents. Yeah, here when you submit a subscription um submission from uh the data group, right?
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The approval will be created under the name deal subscription.
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Once it is approved, it triggers the NAT and workflow and workflow will generate a draft subscription pack in a document uh docs format.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it's for words not a PDF and it will be registered here.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can see subscription pack draft and for opic investor right and this uh you can download it.
 
 
01:01:24
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will be a doc. So you can see the format is docs right. Um this will be a draft and um hello I can hear you.
Julien Machot: I think I lost you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you hear me? Hello.
Julien Machot: Hi.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello. Can you hear me? Hello.
Julien Machot: Hello.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, can you hear me?
Julien Machot: Vanessa, are you there?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Hello. Hello. I cannot hear you. I cannot hear you. Something wrong with the phone.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No. Okay.
Julien Machot: Oh, that's it. I can hear you now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Now you can hear me.
Julien Machot: I don't know what happened. Yeah. Yeah. Now it's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Good.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: That's weird.
Julien Machot: Sorry, I lost you for 15 seconds. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. So, continuing here. um subscription pack is created as docs but it is a draft and um you have to download it right and then you can work on it.
 
 
01:03:11
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you remember last time we agreed on that because you said okay there is a lot of sections that have to be edited specifically to the deal with the investor and then we can uh so there's lawyers that
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: will do edits and all of that. So yeah it is also explained here. So subscription draft generation after the draft is generated stuff review edit. So you know load draft work with lawyers to finalize upload final version send for signature. Um and yeah so when you upload uh when I click here upload final version I can upload um a PDF and the PDF that I have uploaded I can have it like I can view it and then I
Julien Machot: Mhm. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: can download it as well or like click ready for signature. This uh will send the document to be signed right failure to generate document URL because I signed it before so it cannot be redundant. Um but yeah so when you click on ready for signature it generates a signature in versus sign that you go there and then you basically have it uh directly there and you can sign it and it will basically also send a task for the um client so investor where they have to sign it as well but yes so moving on um there's a processes this is basically easy where you can trigger workflow post not a lot
 
 
01:04:37
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for now because um so the ones that are for example the subscription pack the NDA um maybe the invoice and also uh I forgot the last one the certificate
Julien Machot: Heat.
Ghiles Moussaoui: a directly integrated inside automatically I don't know my question is do you have like a use case where you want to create your own NDA directly here by giving the information or you would like to be done automatically. So you want two ways to trigger it. One is automatically, one is manual. Let's say you want to generate an NDA for something that not go through the platform or like also subscription pack or another type of document.
Julien Machot: Right. Right. That that that could be possible. Yes, you're right. Um I don't necessarily have a concrete case now, but uh in the future we may have a need for for such an option.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Okay. And Okay. Yeah. So, this is processes request did not change. Documents changed a little bit.
 
 
01:05:57
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um. Yes. So, documents the way I've done it is a little bit tricky because you have basically a Um you have basically um a folder created for each for each entity uh directly here and then um you can basically have all of the um normally all of the documents let's say for example here and then you go to deal right and then you go to open AAI and the open AI you can go to data room and it navigates to this. So and this is basically um a subscription pack draft. Oh this is not an office this is an NDA. This is can be seen. This is how I've done the um documents and a bit tricky. I think u maybe I've done an error where I have basically created all documents all folders for entities directly. Um instead of doing it as sections as you have done it in Google Drive for in drive you have um oh I don't have it it's new thing.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, what do you think about this?
 
 
01:07:29
 
Julien Machot: Um so that is the that is basically you're saying here it's all the documents ever ever generated right ever produced.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's I like that because we can we can drill down search um and you can organize by filters, by date, by view. That's very good actually. It's like a general log of documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. So, yeah. And you can search for specific vehicle and and there specific vehicle there is stuff to be um filtered and all of that.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And that's basically how it works for now.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We can change it later once it is tested I suppose.
Julien Machot: That was very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And this is versa sign where new basically subscriptions would be create uh not subscription new request for sign in um happens here right and then when you click on sign there is nothing for now I did not I have to create new signature to be able to uh show it but basically for example all of these are completed when I was testing But basically what happens is you click on sign, it opens a small popup where you can just put your signature with the information and then uh it is done.
 
 
01:09:05
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um and the way I've done it is that every time there's a signature, it happens on two parties, right? So on the investor level and also in this super admin level, the admin can sign and also the investor can sign.
Julien Machot: Right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Once both signed, the document is marked as signed and then the automation trig like it triggers for example database trigger changes the label of the subscription which then um changes something new in the code. This is how it works but yeah so this one is test.
Julien Machot: Mhm. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I cannot uh when you click on it nothing happens. Yeah. So fetch signature request it's not existent and yes so introducers change did not change. So there's introducers, introductions, um arrangers, they added versatile management LTD. Um so there's KYC where you can input the documents um required KYC.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah. So this is internal. So um docs. Yeah. So you can click on uploaded docs here.
 
 
01:10:16
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is certificate of incorporation and all of this other stuff. Um yeah. So this is arrangers. Um when you click on edit, this is information. Um yeah. So fees is the same. I think I showed you fees. I'm not sure. Did I show you fees?
Julien Machot: Um, let me see. Uh, this is management. Okay, very good. Yeah, that's very good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So in the fees there is complete fee analysis.
Julien Machot: Was a breakdown.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So there is a breakdown of what is happening.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh committed, pending, active, cancelled, subscriptions and see committed.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is the all the data. There's a lot of stuff. There is pending also a lot of stuff. And then there is uh by vehicle. So for example by vehicle you can see how many fees have been generated performance wise and all that.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So subscription spread and yeah so when you scroll down you can see all Yeah for sure.
 
 
01:11:34
 
Julien Machot: So, so these I'm going to have to to to test it um as soon as we can. I'm going to have to create a real uh a real life uh subscription and run the numbers through through it and see if the formulas are correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: But that looks amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. And what I need to do is I have to create um a mirror board mirror board uh or something like that where I have to explain the workflows because um so the workflows like what happens when you know
Julien Machot: Mhm. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's better than explain it like this right so for example when does a signature event happen like um something that would look like is okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yes. So for example when something triggers uh something happens and then something happens the user has to do this um investor has to do this and then it moves forward into something else. You see what I mean? This is how uh like I need I think I need to it will be better to explain with that I suppose than going to platform.
 
 
01:12:48
 
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um but yeah here how great it would be general I would just like presentation thing.
Julien Machot: And it's so that the mirror board where where would it be? Would it be you mean it would be external?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, just explaining I can also addit like as a docs for like explanatory thing for the platform.
Julien Machot: Okay. Oh, okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Wow. Okay, that's nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Uh fee plans. This is basically you can create a fee plan, assign it with multiple components for example management, subscription, performance, spread, makeup, markup and everything. You can create multiple and then assign it global template or like a specific deal say anthropici and it applies to the deal. Uh then there is invoices. So um in the invoices you can basically I send an invoice. Uh let's say the open eye deal that I have created has this invoice. this um uninvoiceed fees which means basically fee events and when I click plus invoice uh I click okay it adds automatically the subscription I can put the due date I can select okay what do you want to invoice right now um let's say I can invoice everything 12 2025 and then you can have the total you can add lines if you want uh numbers and then I can create the invoice and then when I go here
 
 
01:14:35
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can see the invoice sent uh usually used to yeah invoice mark as sent. Yes. So now I can mark it as paid and yes so schedule there's just a schedule I think I'm not it's not fully implemented.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah it is implemented actually. So you can see schedule of February 2026. This is schedule for recurring fees, right?
Julien Machot: Okay. Nice. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is recurring fees with a schedule. So you can see it here.
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh so you don't lose anything. And then commissions. This is for introd introducers. It is linked with introducers and it is done on the introducers level.
Julien Machot: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah. Then you have reconciliations. Um did I explain to you before about reconciliations?
Julien Machot: Uh, no, no, no, you didn't. Tell tell me Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh okay. So reconciliations when you go here you can import bank data which is basically um I think you can input here a transaction on any form and then the agent will understand it exact information that is needed which are
 
 
01:15:56
 
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay counterparty should be investor the date the amount um and um it's basically and the reference and how it works is that when you add it here you want to be able to match it with um an invoice
Julien Machot: Yeah. Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that you have created internally for let's say a subscription or something like that and you can go to invoices for example the one I've created for a profici uh you can see this it is paid and it's not paid yet so paid is zero and uh see this is sent and matched and when you go back to transactions I can go to any um transaction for example this one right so I can click here and I
Julien Machot: Yep. Very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: can create an so I can choose an invoice and then I can put um create match and it matches directly with what already uh failed update amount could not find updated date.
Julien Machot: Yep. Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, but you can basically match it and then you have the um the amount that is paid, the amount that is not paid and everything in between.
 
 
01:17:12
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you know, okay, did the investor pay everything?
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is he paying in trenches in part?
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And yeah, I think there is an algorithm that auto matches, but I'm not sure if it works correctly for now.
Julien Machot: Fantastic. Listen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But yeah, so that's basically how it works so far.
Julien Machot: Mhm. And and for for an introducer as an account, um uh can they can they lodge an invoice to us for us to pay?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, so basically you have to contact them. Yeah, there is there will be a way to basically send them an email for them to be able to contact us with an invoice, right? And you can label like okay invoice not yet they invoiced us they did not invoice us they are paid they're not paid and all of that but I think what you can do is just tell them to invoice you right there is no nothing like creating an invoice or something yep Yeah.
Julien Machot: No. Yeah. Just they would um what they could do is maybe upload their invoice to to us and then we will receive it in the system and decide to approve or not.
 
 
01:18:30
 
Julien Machot: Maybe we can reject it with comments if there's an error or do do you think that's possible?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, do you want them to have a versat um Okay.
Julien Machot: Um I think so. I think so. What do you think? I think so. I think so. I think they have to have a versatile tech account as well as an introducer. Just like the lawyer will have an account, I think the introducer will have an account. Uh- because it makes sense, right? If we want to if we want to to to intensify and increase the the relationship with uh one of these parties, they need to have an account as well, I suppose.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh what what are the features that will they have the introducers?
Julien Machot: Uh the introducers primarily invite people, right? invite people in uh g get them get them connected up with us so that we can we can um contact them, get to know them, on board them um give them the chance to fill up the KYC um give them the chance to have NDA for an opportunity and then the invoicing of the introducer to us as well when the when a transaction is successful.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Go to um Yes.
Julien Machot: Uh, if I can um if I can ask you a favor if we could stop the call for now here because I I noticed I'm late for my other call. Um, because I I think we've already seen like mo most of it really.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. I think mostly. Yes.
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Julien Machot: So, can you think about the next step for me and my team to start like working and also like making sure we upload as much data as possible because we should you and I should um we should really sort of define a date uh when we intend to launch and how we're going to do it. Amazing. Okay. And I can maybe call you a bit later as well.
