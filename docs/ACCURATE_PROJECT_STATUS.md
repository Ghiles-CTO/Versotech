## üöß PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

### 6. Staff Portal - **60% Complete**
**Status: Needs Backend Integration**

**What Works:**
- All staff portal pages exist and render correctly
- Professional UI with operational-looking dashboards
- Complete navigation and layout system
- Role-based access control working

**What's Missing:**
- **Mock Data**: All KPIs show hardcoded values (127 LPs, 342 workflows, 99.7% compliance)
- **No Real Database Queries**: Staff portal pages don't connect to actual data
- **Placeholder Functionality**: Links exist but don't perform real operations

**Key Issues:**
- `src/app/(staff)/versotech/staff/page.tsx` shows static numbers instead of database queries
- Deal management exists but needs backend integration
- Process automation shows n8n integration placeholders

### 7. Database Schema - **90% Complete**
**Status: Comprehensive Schema, Needs Data Population**

**What's Implemented:**
- **Complete Schema**: 30+ tables with proper relationships
- **Sophisticated Structure**: Support for deals, vehicles, positions, valuations, subscriptions
- **Advanced Features**: Fee management, document handling, audit trails
- **Proper Constraints**: Foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints

**Database Entities & Relationships:**
```
Core Structure:
- profiles (users) ‚Üí investor_users ‚Üí investors
- investors ‚Üí positions ‚Üí vehicles
- investors ‚Üí subscriptions ‚Üí vehicles
- vehicles ‚Üí valuations (NAV history)
- deals ‚Üí deal_memberships (access control)
- deals ‚Üí deal_commitments (investment submissions)

Advanced Features:
- fee_plans ‚Üí fee_components (fee structures)
- term_sheets (investment terms)
- capital_calls & distributions (cash flows)
- documents (with watermarking support)
- audit_events (compliance tracking)
```

**What's Missing:**
- Production data population
- Some staff portal queries not implemented

---

## ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED / PLACEHOLDERS

### 1. Real Data Integration for Staff Portal
**Issue**: Staff portal shows mock data instead of real database queries
**Impact**: Cannot be used in production without data integration

### 2. Document Management System
**Issue**: Document upload/download functionality is incomplete
**Impact**: Users cannot access actual documents

### 3. n8n Workflow Integration
**Issue**: Process automation exists as UI placeholders only
**Impact**: Operational workflows not functional

### 4. Real Production Data
**Issue**: Database exists but needs to be populated with actual investment data
**Impact**: System works with demo data only

---

## üìä Database Architecture (Actually Implemented)

The database is comprehensively designed with proper investment management structure:

### Core Business Logic:
1. **Multi-Tenancy**: Users can represent multiple investor entities
2. **Vehicle Management**: Funds, SPVs, securitizations with separate tracking
3. **Deal-Based Access**: Investment opportunities with member-based permissions
4. **Financial Precision**: High-precision decimals for accurate calculations
5. **Audit Compliance**: Hash-chained audit trails for regulatory requirements

### Key Relationships:
- **Users ‚Üî Investors**: Many-to-many through `investor_users`
- **Investors ‚Üî Vehicles**: Many-to-many through `subscriptions`
- **Positions**: One per investor per vehicle
- **Deals**: Independent investment opportunities with member access
- **Financial Data**: Valuations, capital calls, distributions with proper timestamping

## üéØ What Needs to Be Completed for Production

### High Priority (Essential):
1. **Staff Portal Data Integration**: Connect all staff pages to real database queries
2. **Production Data Migration**: Populate database with actual investment data
3. **Document System**: Implement file upload/download with proper security
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing with real data flows

### Medium Priority (Important):
1. **n8n Integration**: Connect workflow automation for operational efficiency
2. **Email Notifications**: Implement email sending for deal updates and capital calls
3. **Advanced Reporting**: Add export capabilities for financial reports
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance mobile experience

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Add charts and graphs for performance visualization
2. **Multi-Language Support**: Add internationalization
3. **Advanced Security**: Implement 2FA and additional security measures

**Key Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ Robust authentication and security
- ‚úÖ Complete investor portal with real data integration
- ‚úÖ Sophisticated database architecture
- ‚úÖ Professional UI/UX design

**Key Gaps:**
- üöß Staff portal needs backend data integration
