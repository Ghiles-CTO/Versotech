Fred Demargne: that was not unlocked what we saw before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's not I
Fred Demargne: It was not before remember we earlier today. So now um yeah and now is
Ghiles Moussaoui: think

Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, if you turn on the document,
Fred Demargne: If I download a document,

Fred Demargne: I show you going to show my screen here. So I'm in the space same investment opportunity here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: By the way, here the logo doesn't fit well in the in the space.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Let me see the logo in the previous page.
 
 
00:12:24
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: same because the logo
Fred Demargne: I don't know why because it was good for perplexity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: size you uploaded is like a rectangle, not a square. Um, but the UI it's not dynamic. It's just just shows square and it tries to fit size inside instead of zooming it in or out.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Well, I can work on it if you
Fred Demargne: No, it's not.
Ghiles Moussaoui: want.
Fred Demargne: Uh I think you're going to spend lots of time on this. No need. So I'm opening now the investment opportunity. So some documents are featured.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So the PDF is fine. The image you see
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me see. I had that issue on the video. Um, but I fixed it. Okay. So, I will fix it right now and I will push I think once uh let's you know move forward and we get back to it once I tell you it's done. Will take maybe 5 minutes or
Fred Demargne: Okay.
 
 
00:14:14

Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah, let me see. I need
Fred Demargne: Cuz here I didn't want to give you another template that you don't over complexify it.

Fred Demargne: You shouldn't have virtual capital 2 CSP series and then virtual capital 2 SCSP series 600
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh the first one should be okay. It should it should be Yeah. Here too.
Fred Demargne: here as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The duplication Yes.
 
 
00:28:12
 
Fred Demargne: You see look your subscription summary the top here it's not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's the same issue if you remember repeated in term sheet in NDA and now subscription.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I will fix the duplication and um the first
Fred Demargne: So here the format is not correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: capital
Fred Demargne: So there should be a comma because there should be the US format. There should be a comma after the first zero for 50,000.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 50,000 US format.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, it should be with a comma after 50.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: The same for the equity certificate should be 50,000.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, the price per share was not one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What was
Fred Demargne: What was it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: it?
Fred Demargne: Term sheet. Um, in the term sheet it's 198.12.12.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Can you go back? Uh or here can you go to details or I will do it on my site.
Fred Demargne: Where details?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:29:34
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh the tab tab called details near the documents tab
Fred Demargne: Where?
Ghiles Moussaoui: inside this page. Yeah. here if you scroll down. Um, okay. Okay. Price per share. Can you try to go back to the documents? Can you select uh PDF in the regenerate near regenerate PDF? Can you click regenerate? Okay. Uh, can you please
Fred Demargne: is change the price.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: It shouldn't be a star here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry,
Fred Demargne: There shouldn't be a star after the 12 here
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't understand. Did not hear you.
Fred Demargne: price. Here you have a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: star.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Should I remove it?
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: because you put a comment here. Yeah. Also, yeah, it's tricky this. So, how do we select the templates to use?
Ghiles Moussaoui: the template.
Fred Demargne: Because depending on the depending on the perform of the on the deal, we might use different templates.
 
 
00:31:30
 
Fred Demargne: You see here, for instance, there is not really a price per share. It's just indicative. So there's a comment underneath saying that the price per share may be abandoned by the issuer. Um but in most cases we have the price per share. So there's some there can be some slight
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: differences
Ghiles Moussaoui: Well, um Okay. Okay. Okay. What we can do is have some dynamic template where text is only visible. If it's only a text issue or like notice comment issue where uh there is no price per share, it will show the text and hide the field or something like that. What do you think?
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah, but they don't have those.
Fred Demargne: Maybe.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know them.
Fred Demargne: So then let me review in detail first.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And uh
Fred Demargne: Um here we are missing the series
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: number.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Here you see the layout is not good.
 
 
00:32:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: Um again here we are missing the series number. Here the law firm is not correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: This cogent is not this. Here the the email is on
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh the yeah those are not
Fred Demargne: this
Ghiles Moussaoui: um ex exclusive arranger entro agent it's uh okay is this inside the template I mean inside the PDFs I think it this.
Fred Demargne: What do you mean? Is it inside the PDF? I am on the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: PDF.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the the PDF from Julian. Okay, I will fix them. Yeah, they are inside the the PDF from Julian. It's an error from my side when I created the
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: template
Fred Demargne: Here there's a reference. It says null. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: where reference. Yeah. Uh because there is no database reference.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh it's called agency vers 2 um CSP series. Should I add it? Yeah, I will add it.
 
 
00:34:05
 
Fred Demargne: You have a free text and dynamic field.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So actually the the dynamic fields I I think I told you before but the way I created them is I just compare the PDFs to see what changes from one PDF to the other.
Fred Demargne: Okay, I cannot zoom in here, but you see the this should go above on the same page.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Thanks for consideration. Oh yeah, the signature just after thanks for your consideration should be above.
Fred Demargne: Here
Ghiles Moussaoui: That is correct.
Fred Demargne: you are missing a number here under a number and then there's no number.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is it?
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: agreement.
Fred Demargne: Guess what? Check. One second. I climb back.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep,
Fred Demargne: Two
Ghiles Moussaoui: no problem.
Fred Demargne: seconds. I'm back. Can you hear me?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I can I
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, you need to view I think the the company number here and number is
Ghiles Moussaoui: think number.
Fred Demargne: missing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
 
 
00:38:08
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I I've checked. Okay. So, I think there is a lot of text um here and there that is little bit missing.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, here you see here a PR Julian.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Here
Fred Demargne: It shouldn't be with registered office. It should be with passport number or ID number and registered address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's uh the investor name a qualified investor with the register residential address at king in the United States the
Fred Demargne: Yes, that's not that's not what we have now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: subscriber. Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So maybe you want to review it in detail because I think there are basic
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So,
Fred Demargne: uh mistakes here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: so what I propose is I will send the new version uh just after the meeting. I not just after the meeting but tonight and uh yeah so tonight and then and then tomorrow so we can review it. It makes more sense to review it tomorrow. after I align it a little bit more so there isn't any of these mistakes in the wordings and stuff as much as I can
 
 
00:39:21
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: catch
Fred Demargne: So here some management. So if I go all the way down here again the reference here is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. No bank account reference.
Fred Demargne: no
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: here there's a problem of layout look here 61 I think I think there should be a title, but if there's no title,
Ghiles Moussaoui: You see a little
Fred Demargne: it shouldn't go.
Ghiles Moussaoui: calculation. Yeah, it should be near the text
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 61.
Fred Demargne: So here the same 9.1 9.2 as
Ghiles Moussaoui: 91.
Fred Demargne: well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. as
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: well. Here there's a problem. The the line here should be above the name. The same here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Where? Okay. Before appendex
Fred Demargne: Here
Ghiles Moussaoui: line just
Fred Demargne: we are missing the page number. I think I can't see the page number.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah patient number is missing
Fred Demargne: I think here we are missing a space with a signature without signing it.
 
 
00:41:53
 
Fred Demargne: I think here we are missing a a page.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah yeah yeah not the page the signature thing for the abandoned.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: here you're not supposed to put the name of the investor
Ghiles Moussaoui: I know
Fred Demargne: here. And yeah, you're not supposed to put the
Ghiles Moussaoui: from so nothing should be added to the
Fred Demargne: date.
Ghiles Moussaoui: appendix.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. No, it's um it's a form to be used in due time.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay, understood. Okay, I will patch the issues and yeah.
Fred Demargne: So should I still continue back as final to continue the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: process?
Ghiles Moussaoui: why not
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: click on ready for signature? No,
Fred Demargne: So who signs first?
Ghiles Moussaoui: not you have to still put ready for signature. it will be created. So here Kia Juliano will have to sign Verso capital to uh GP sal issuer and vers.
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: it's good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: now I need to sign myself I believe.
 
 
00:43:26
 
Fred Demargne: Failed to initiate signature workflow.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Uh I'm investigating what is happening right now. Uh do you prefer to move forward on other tests that they have done and then come back to this?
Fred Demargne: the test you've done or I've
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh for example, the image preview here.
Fred Demargne: done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you try again?
Fred Demargne: It's working.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you double right click and see? Try to download. Okay. In the data rooms, not here. If you go to data rooms, can you try to download anything and tell me
Fred Demargne: So, did you change that when you open the fight?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello. Hello. Think your voice cut off.
Fred Demargne: No. Hear
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: me?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Your voice is cutting off. Maybe internet issue.
Fred Demargne: No, I don't think so. There's nobody using internet now. Everybody's sleeping, so there shouldn't be a problem. So, um I think um I think it's better you fix now.
 
 
00:46:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: Uh what you have to fix. Maybe before I go back to it. Um, it seems like I can download here this one should be downloadable because it's a feature document but it's not downloadable here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: nothing can be downloaded.
Fred Demargne: It's
Ghiles Moussaoui: from the data rooms. But when you go to the features section, you
Fred Demargne: okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: can
Fred Demargne: So if I click here oh it's working. I cannot save as it's working.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So listen, I think it's better we continue once the subscription pack is fixed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Makes sense.
Fred Demargne: Um uh because now it doesn't I'm not able to sign anything. Let me see if it arrives here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Your subscription has been approved.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is the approval? 25 minutes ago.
Fred Demargne: Why do I have this here? It's a new message.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Additional information required. Oh yeah, I was testing. Maybe.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I was testing uh the changes. All of the 20 changes I've
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: done.
Fred Demargne: So, do you want to spend the time to fix the uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. Yes.
Fred Demargne: Okay. All right. So, we guess tomorrow you let me know when it's fixed so that I know when I start again testing tomorrow. Okay. All right.
