Ghiles Moussaoui: Look. Um, damn it. Look for all of the user story stories in mobile uh V6 file Excel all of them right from the f****** arranger to the last CEO everybody is inside the main portal. We have the f****** main view, but the admin is another portal and it didn't give you the admin yet. I didn't give you the user like the SAS growth. You know what about it? But what are you doing? I don't understand. Did all of the f****** files in planning are wrong or what? Can you take all of the f****** files in planning and analyze this s***? Like what have you been doing from earlier? I said doing you were doing everything right. Like what are you doing? Did you think of f****** multiple portals? What the f***? It is time for you.
Fred Demargne: Sorry. Hello. Hello. Mute. Hello.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: I'm sorry, but the uh your email didn't come through.
 
 
00:05:30
 
Fred Demargne: Uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: I cannot hear you. Oh, sorry. Yeah, now I can hear
Fred Demargne: No worries. Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you.
Fred Demargne: When I send the invite, since you asked me for um uh for the for the for the Google Meet link instead of the Zoom, I didn't put it and then uh I didn't get your email right away and I made a mistake with the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah.
Fred Demargne: with the invite. So, sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's fine. Um, how are you doing?
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I'm good. I'm very good. And you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Good. Good. Uh, I'm doing the plan, the architecture plan for I call it phase two of development.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, are you is it complicated or is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um it's a little bit complicated but um it's just
Fred Demargne: it
Ghiles Moussaoui: structural things because for example for the investor the way I built it before it's restricted there is um some restricted uh parole there has to be a user role so they can access a portal inside the database the back end and everything so they never have the ability to extract data data that they should shouldn't have uh the ability to have.
 
 
00:06:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh but now I have to rewrite that and I think the login will also change. So the authentification system um data model will also have to change because now it's users. It's not specifically um company and customers but it's users including you know multiple views like CEO all of the user journeys and admin is something else. And I think admin, do you think it's um it's better to make it another platform by itself or do you think it's just um better if you make it another portal inside the platform?
Fred Demargne: What difference
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when code um usually
Fred Demargne: make?
Ghiles Moussaoui: when you create the CMS for website or mobile app is usually another code that you deploy by itself. Um just because for example if you have is if you have it as a B portal inside one code you can't have both in the same browser right you open one portal and you try to open the other portal it goes to the uh current portal so if you refresh the old one just goes to the same
 
 
00:08:02
 
Fred Demargne: Is it more more complicated for you to have it as a separate platform or it's
Ghiles Moussaoui: portal
Fred Demargne: easier?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um um so the thing is for now we didn't uh really I mean I don't really know how much I have to work on the admin um you can see a lot of the journeys there are empty the features so for example I need to understand what is SAS management what does that concretely mean and also the growth marketing and all is it like triggers or is it a place to do everything. Um, and also, you know, does it connect to the database that we currently have or is it a section of it? Is it new database? Um, yeah, I think it connects but not entirely. For example, for
Fred Demargne: I think we need to have a new database of payers.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the
Fred Demargne: If they pay assess a fee, I think it needs to be a different database than the investor base because maybe not all the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: investor will pay.
 
 
00:09:03
 
Fred Demargne: Maybe some investors um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah. No. Um, I'm talking about for example the prospects, right? When you're doing growth marketing or something, let's say we're scraping sales navigator or some other data set, right? For prospects, investor, family offices and stuff. You don't want to store everything in the main database, right? Because you will scrape thousands of records so you can reach out to them. And it's like a GTM system. It's a go to market. It's usually better if done in a more visual way. let's say the CRM or like uh I have no DB in air table as well um hosted. So yeah that um there will be some decisions to take
Fred Demargne: For me, for me, for me, the the initial platform,
Ghiles Moussaoui: there.
Fred Demargne: the way it was designed, it was not to be, it was not supposed to be a CRM tool. And then Julian constantly is mixing between being a CRM and being a transaction tool. So my view is this
 
 
00:10:05
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: um for me in the admin this work about uh you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: know trying to get some new uh to to uh get some new contact and then potentially get a relationship with them so that afterwards they uh enroll to the platform is completely outside of the platform
Ghiles Moussaoui: So is that the admin? Do you consider that
Fred Demargne: for For me the admin is not this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: as
Fred Demargne: I mean part of the admin could be this but for me the gross marketing of the admin the way I was looking into it is more how to optimize there are different way different objective of the growth marketing. One is to improve the user journey. So what can we do the from the KPI that we will get of the usage of the different journey in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: in the in the platform. What can we do better? What can we improve? So that's one of the things.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: The second thing is how can we push for them to do more uh or to repeat more.
 
 
00:11:06
 
Fred Demargne: So tactics that when they are already in a platform what can we do so that they invest more and what can we do that they for those who are leaving us to try to prevent them from leaving us. So what can we do to identify those journey and and provide uh uh offers for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: them?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand. It's more customer success uh and you know learning from the customer
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: example from the you know giving them accurate investment opportunities
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: based on let's say what they answer to the forms uh that we have the questionnaires
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right and also learning from the behavior.
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So for me for the for for for Jerry we don't need to have this machine of getting new clients ready. What we need for Jerry is the system works for our customer our customers uh to be able to offer them uh a couple of investment opportunity where they can invest
 
 
00:11:59
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: in.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: So I don't if you prefer this part of the of the of the platform you can you can separate it for the moment it we can you cannot do everything at the same time. So we need to focus the focus day on okay on the on the Dday I need to be able to launch a platform um where I need to invite my customers or my
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: existing customer to join the platform uh and provide them access to se to different features several feature will be about seeing what they've already invested in in with us other thing will be to offer them new investment opportunities there will not be many But there will be a couple maybe one or two in the beginning so that you know it's animated and stuff and then we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: will ask them to update their KYC uh uh because for most of them probably has expired and I told Julian instead of going through a complex process to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Thanks.
Fred Demargne: batch to have a batch with all the the the documents that we already have it's better that we consider we don't have them and we ask them to resubmit their documentation to us.
 
 
00:13:16
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think yeah I think when it comes to that there would be I think specific things
Fred Demargne: Uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: where the agent does everything right. For example, when you somebody uploads the um ID or something, first they have to put the expiration date, right, as an input, including the document.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And for other documents, um you know, we can have AI analyze it visually and extract the metadata of the document based on the document type. And that could be some like you know an agent that takes into consideration the date in the database. Once it is you know five days or like one month before the document expires. It notifies the investor or the specific user to upload the new document either for their entity or the member inside the entity and they have to.
Fred Demargne: No, no, I agree. I agree.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I just didn't want So once we already have all the d all the documents inside the platform, of of course we can do that, but I don't want to complexify too too much the launch.
 
 
00:14:22
 
Fred Demargne: I agree that moving forward,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: we will we will have an agent that will be tracking this. So we will be able to automatically re ask the investor to update
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: their uh proof of address or proof of identification.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: But I was just referring to the launch to the launch since we will have in our in our drive we will have users with KYC information which will have expired other which will not have expired.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I said to Jan, listen, it's much better if we ask all of them to resubmit their uh KYC
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: documentation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So you know for me the focus for January is is is really this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: So I think forget about the uh acquisition tool for the moment. Uh we can do that after it's launched.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think for me at the moment is really purely to make the core platform to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand.
 
 
00:15:23
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And I agree.
Fred Demargne: So, so I don't know if you already had a chance to start m uh so the decision the question you asked me
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I mean I think for me it's fine either way uh to have it as a separate platform or having it just as a B portal whatever you call it. Uh I agree that it would probably be better for Jun and I that it's a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: separate platform because we don't have to open different browser uh to be able to do to to use the admin and the user but also we could live with it you know uh if it's really
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: more complicated uh we can live with it uh having a A and B portal and managing it the way we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um, got it. I will I will I have to structure it. I have to understand um because you know if I create another portal by itself or an entire new uh platform I have to think of how to connect it to the platform because as you told me the growth marketing to the investor and all which is more customer success and tracking of um what happens in the platform.
 
 
00:16:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think that means uh it will be connected to the main database. Um because all the investor and user data is there and their KYC and everything.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um and I think all of the KPIs everything that you want to track the charts and everything would spring from the main database. So as main portal I think uh in you know I think it's better to put it in one uh code and then later we can just split it.
Fred Demargne: I think so. Especially if you are telling me it's because of what you just said,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Amen.
Fred Demargne: it's going to be much easier for you to leave it as a B portal. Let's leave it as a B portal because that's not critical from a from a a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: success point of view. It is not critical for the launch.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: So keep keep this the easiest way for this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Now we can really focus on what is what is core.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
 
 
00:17:37
 
Fred Demargne: But again again the acquisition of new clients for the moment just forget about it. If it means to get rid of the code to I mean to to keep the code aside
Ghiles Moussaoui: I'm not focusing Yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh just do it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean I'm not focusing on I'm focusing on the code. Um that I think is something else because it rely on external tools a lot. So if anything it would be just connected to the portal or the other platform. It doesn't really matter. What we can do as well is even if we have one code, we have two portals, we can deploy both portals in a separate um you know in separate URLs. So you have a URL for let's say admin and when you go there you only go to the admin section and the normal URL which goes to the main um you know main portal but it's the same code. is just one only opens one portal and the other one only opens the same another portal.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay.
 
 
00:18:41
 
Fred Demargne: So, let's uh let's keep it simple for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um Okay. Another thing I was thinking about is there is specifically in the user journeys uh for example the partner and investor and introducers have many things in common right this is the hybrid user um so they have many things in common which means I think an introducer can be an investor and the partner also can invest right and they want to see um maybe the investor um you know in the tracking bar of the investment journey I think you would like the partner to see where the investor is specifically, right?
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it's like Yeah.
Fred Demargne: For the partner. Yes. For the introducer. No. For the introducer, we don't need to know for the introducer until so he he has
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: an account in our in our prof in our platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: he uh he receives uh a fee uh a fee proposal uh from us from the CEO telling him
 
 
00:19:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: well okay if you introduce us to XYZ to to Rise for instance then you're going to get uh 1% uh fee on the total investment of KS okay so the guy the introducer needs
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: to agree And then if he agrees, he's going to uh he's going to be able to introduce us to a user into the platform. So either he do it himself by inviting a user that we need to approve or he's sending us a contact detail and we invite
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: the user for the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay, I understand.
Fred Demargne: partner and the client. Uh there is no such process. um you know the partner will tell us so it would be me or Dan or or Julian so we know a client
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: we're just going to invite him you know what I mean uh we're not going to go through a process of um uh agreeing for a specific transaction and so on and so forth afterwards there will need to be some fees associated to the uh the partnership um but he's going the the the the the beginning of the process is much
 
 
00:21:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: easier.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um what I'm thinking of let's say the partner is um okay one of you as you said maybe the CEO as well right so the partner does mean they can invest as well right but do
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: they h do they see the same um view as the investor including their own view or it's something you know completely different Because would they
Fred Demargne: Well, you can keep it you can keep it the same.
Ghiles Moussaoui: treat
Fred Demargne: I think if it's simplifies for the partner, the the partner can see everything that the investor sees.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You just cannot act on it. No. Uh he cannot sign obviously he cannot sign a document on on behalf of the of the investor. He cannot uh he cannot he cannot have access to this but um but the partner it's not a problem that he has there is commercial
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: partner because there are two two types of partners you know if you noticed there is a partner like uh like like Julian myself or Dan then there is a what we call the commercial partner
 
 
00:22:22
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Mhm.
Fred Demargne: in that case a commercial partner partner is um it can work in two different ways. It can either um so commercial partner can be a bank for instance. So you know you are you know in a bank you so sometime we will not know the name of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: investors we will know the bank and we will just going to have a a client ID uh that we're going to use to tell where this customer wants to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: invest. it will be the client number 001 of a commercial partner uh BNP parath.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So in that case the commercial partner needs to see everything because he's actually doing the execution himself. In other cases uh it will be a normal investor and in that case do we want the the bank to know everything the client is doing? U listen I think for the moment we should keep it simple um so let's leave it like this like any partner I think it's easier know if any partner see what the investor is doing
 
 
00:23:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I think what like so we we going through you know we're going through each uh feature um but usually So I I use the user journeys to default to when I'm trying to understand what I'm trying to do right when I default to the user journeys um and you know I try to make sense of what we already have which is the features like the opportunities the series and all and how to incorporate the views for each uh user journey so that they can have the you know the features and the journeys inside the Excel that you send me and this means for me when for example if the partner has the ability to invest C maybe investors that are related to them I'm not sure if this is correct um then it's something um you know completely different from the commercial uh partner commercial partner is more like an external thing so I would cross uh analyze the user journeys and we'll see okay where there will be you know very similar user journeys or completely intertwined and they can you know from there the view for a specific thing specific user um will change which means one user could be the combination of user journeys of two um other user types and this means also um I have to change the database because for now the database uh you know is you know company and investors and customers mostly so I have to change all of these structure to make this happen and yeah the code as well.
 
 
00:25:32
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is where there is uh some difficulties where it could take some
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: time.
Fred Demargne: So maybe I mean here we need to be we're not going to have 100% of everything ready at the same time. So we have to be smart.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So
Fred Demargne: If it's easier, if it's easier for the beginning that to have the partners to only see uh a few
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: things, uh maybe that's what we should do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh to limit the partner connection so that he can see maybe he needs to see which investment opportunity was shared to his clients because when we dispatch it that it needs to be associated to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Exactly.
Fred Demargne: it and maybe that's that's it in
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this Yeah.
Fred Demargne: terms of what the investment is at the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay. So what I I'm doing right now is I'm writing a plan with phases, right? Because we will not push everything at once. We will create phases.
 
 
00:26:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think first I have to merge both portals and then make it so um that we can add you know phases and views for each user and I think I will share with you with the plan um I will write it so it is comprehensive in a business logic as well and you can confirm with me what we uh should keep and what we shouldn't and then we can basically act on that and add uh specific you know we would review after each phase and add um maybe some changes after each phase is done but we would like to I think it's better to keep some you know a master plan that we can operate on because we need to move fast right so we have to identify okay what needs to be done before 10th of
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: January everything and then uh subtile features that can be added later on without any impact or like any uh impact for the people that you would invite to use it the platform. So this is how I'm thinking about it right now.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
 
 
00:27:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so yeah, what do you think?
Fred Demargne: And we need to address the data model so that it's it's comprehensive because I think the data model was not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: complete. That's something that I'd like to discuss today if we can. But yes, in general, yes,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: you just need to understand that Joan will want by the 10th of January to have everything.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: I don't know if you get to understand how it works but so um so we need to make sure that it's uh you know I it's it's we are we prepare it properly so that we explain to him and and convince him that the part that we will not be ready by the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: 10th of January are not critical for the launch.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yes, of course. I mean, yeah. Um I think that will be defined after you see the plan.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The plan I think uh I will try to make it as um you know I will add all the phases um until the final version right and then we can decide okay we can also decide to keep everything if um if it is you know accurate and the vision is the same so I can just work on it until it's done I think it can be done by the beginning of January before the 10th And yeah and if
 
 
00:29:04
 
Fred Demargne: and remember that we have to test as well before the 10th.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you yeah of course uh that takes a little
Fred Demargne: We going to have to test
Ghiles Moussaoui: bit of time as well when I need you know the test needs also some debugging. So obviously there will be some issues because when you build stuff on top of what exists it breaks some processes that you have to retest after the views have changed the structure changed especially role level policies which means some data is restricted to specific users. Uh for now it is staff, super admin, admin and investor and so it will we will add new users and we will have to restructure the entire role level um of superb basease. This means that when you forget one or two sometimes you will go in and you won't be able to see specific data specific data in the your dashboard or also do crude operations which means you can't you will try to create a record or like an investor user if you're not of a certain um yeah if you're not of a certain user type that is restricted the data is restricted or like the table restricted to that you won't be able to do anything.
 
 
00:30:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So all of that has to be tested. All of the document generation um the triggers for automations uh the chron jobs the scheduled automations and data based triggers all of that is the main thing to test and um yeah. Yes.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um, so that's fine for me. I don't know. When do you think you're going to have a first version of this plan?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Ah, today I will send it to you by the end of the
Fred Demargne: Okay, perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: day.
Fred Demargne: Um I wanted to cover some points about the data model uh if we can now
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, please do. Yes.
Fred Demargne: uh especially uh so on the user if we start with the user management because
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I have to say it's very complicated to go through the documentation that um or the software you send me. So the one thing which I I'd like to go through with you is for I mean first of all
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: we need to call things differently with different names.
 
 
00:31:25
 
Fred Demargne: So an investor who is um not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: um a physical person, I think we should call it an entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So okay let me go to the table specifically. So when I go to investors how it is structured right now is there is the ID the legal name the type KYC status there is the country. So created that.
Fred Demargne: Can you share your Can you share your screen while you are reading it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: So maybe it's going to be
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Sorry.
Fred Demargne: easier.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see my screen?
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So this is the investor table. This is its data. When I go here in the bottom, I can click definition and I can see uh the code. Um but yeah I don't think this only if you can if you want to analyze it with other uh tools AI or something. So yeah we have the ID we have the legal name the type. So here type is there is individual there is entity right the name of the table is investor.
 
 
00:32:40
 
Fred Demargne: That's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And there is a type to it and KYC status and displayed name,
Fred Demargne: good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: email, phone, country of incorporation, tax agency. Um, mostly everything.
Fred Demargne: Where where did you get this cape this uh field from?
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you mean?
Fred Demargne: So how did you come up with those fields?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I planned it in the beginning and they thought okay all this makes sense and also when you create an investor right because I discussed it with Julian multiple times he told me okay metadata of the investor and what uh is what it is connected to. So KYC documents, their own documents,
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: the deal documents and no I came
Fred Demargne: so it didn't tell it didn't send you a list of fields because there
Ghiles Moussaoui: up uh with it by myself.
Fred Demargne: are things missing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So um the database is structured it by
Fred Demargne: I think I think the database I think uh if we want to make it proper I don't know if we're going to
 
 
00:33:40
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: myself.
Fred Demargne: have time before the 10th of January but we cannot mix user details of a of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: an investor and then uh database which uh uh gets all the information of where he is at in the process of being created. So for me the onboarding status needs to be in a different database than the clients the investor database the uh KYC completed status uh the KYC expiry dates you know we've got different documents so different documents will have different expiry
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. So, um many fields uh I would say don't make sense. You can see um so they don't disturb because I just left them. We developed the platform. We tried to make it quick. So I just left them. But they are not used in the UI. So they're mostly static um you know fields can be deleted and I make changes every time I create staging tables to add data and change stuff. So yeah, I mean we can correct it but um the system is also a little complicated which means the KYC there is KYC documents table by itself right this is just a reference to completed ad KYC completed means all the requirements for KYC which means all the documents should be completed and uh it's not just for the
 
 
00:35:11
 
Fred Demargne: Okay. So you have so you have KYC and compliance.
Ghiles Moussaoui: entity um
Fred Demargne: No, this is two different KPI two different
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: fields.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. KYC. Sorry. Sorry. What? KYC and compliance. What should be the compliance
Fred Demargne: So for compliance you the so KYC is providing the documentation that we need to be able
Ghiles Moussaoui: about?
Fred Demargne: to know our customer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: So we need to receive uh proof of address uh proof of identity and to get you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: know uh uh the corresponding information in the application in the platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: The compliance is you know we're going to have some uh it's a questionnaire where you uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: you ask a investor different questions to be able to understand is a suitability for him to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: invest in risky less risky very risky investments. Uh so we have a questionnaire for that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
 
 
00:36:04
 
Fred Demargne: It's a completely separate from the KYC. Uh and and here the idea for us is to use this opportunity of a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: boring questionnaire to uh to use it to try to uh animate you know the platform and the users and and trying to make sense for for them as
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah. I mean it's implemented.
Fred Demargne: well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's another uh if I search the table I think questionaireers or signature request. No, I think it's uh on boarding. No, I forgot the table name. Um but wait,
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can look for it if it is necessary.
Fred Demargne: No, it's not critical for now. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I just think that we need to clean a bit the database so that in the investor uh for me it doesn't make sense to have um a database co-
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: investor. it should be the user the profile the the user profile I don't know how you want to separate it from the actual user logging in with his login and password so you can you can call it user profile I don't know but for me whether he's an investor introducer or a partner or whatever it's the same uh for us it's going to be exactly the
 
 
00:37:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yes. Okay. So the UI would be the same. This investor we would need an investor table, right? Um and then we will need an introducer arranger table. all of those tables that when when they create an account it's created automatically a profile and investor is created automatically and when you go to users and UI you will see everything combined right because if I change the uh investor investors table to some new table I would change the name and incorporate every um login or like profile there then it will break all of the other um investor portal features that are restricted to investor like say KYC or the journey of um the journey of investment. So it's better to add
Fred Demargne: I see. I see what you mean. But the best way to do this would have been to have a field in the user uh table to with
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: a role and based on the role then you can restrict based on the role not based off whether the the record exist in the investor base in the investor.
 
 
00:38:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, um, schema public. Sorry, I can go authentification. I'm sorry. No, it's not here. Oh, it's here. So, when I go to authentification, I go to uh users. Um, it's different. Users are the people that created an account that logged in. So you can see here ID, instance and also ro. So sorry.
Fred Demargne: This makes sense. Yeah, this makes
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. And then um there will be profiles as well.
Fred Demargne: sense.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when a user is created, they create the profile. User is on authentification uh table. There is also profile I think here. No, I have to go to public. profiles. So yeah, a user is connected to a profile. A profile can be so ro you can see here um they have there is staff admining investor here I think the profiles would be all of the other roles which means not these specifically but you know CEO arranger lawyer and all it would
 
 
00:40:10
 
Fred Demargne: Yes. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: be mostly here and for the investor there is user investor uh table that connects the user which means the account by itself the login information right uh the person that logs in via one um machine one PC to the investor account that we have the investor table I showed you and this is why it's makes more sense to add okay arrangers and then there will be user and then to a profile profile with um role arranger which will create an automatically I will create a tables but it will create a record in inside arranger users and then it will um it would a be able to, you know, sign in and do all of the stuff. But yeah,
Fred Demargne: Go.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it requires uh some addon and also some changes um along the way. Yeah. And you have a question regarding
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the
Fred Demargne: So my main question was about the uh user who are not just single user which are entities.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um Yes.
Fred Demargne: So I need to understand um exactly how you how did you organize the tables in data modial so that we understand that
 
 
00:41:25
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh you know you you still have the uh the users because an entity can be an arranger entity a partner entity uh investor entity it could be
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Uhhuh.
Fred Demargne: whatever and it's uh it's uh made each entity is made
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: of several users Uh some
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: users um uh have different rules which we need to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Fred Demargne: reflect because uh for for instance for once
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: something very stupid but very basic. Not all the user of an entity needs to sign documentation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Only the main uh person, right?
Fred Demargne: No, there could be multiple
Ghiles Moussaoui: Or yeah, that for example has to be defined which user or like which members at what uh with what
Fred Demargne: ones.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you know title can sign uh documents
Fred Demargne: So normally normally the way it's done in the industry is you have people called
Ghiles Moussaoui: because
Fred Demargne: signaturaries. So those who are uh defining themselves as signatories are the one who needs to sign any documentation related to the uh entity.
 
 
00:42:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So it means that we need to have a field uh with in the database to identify and to ask you know because that's something that we cannot know ourselves.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So you need something that in the KYC process the each individual users
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: associated to an entity needs to say whether they are senatories or not. So it can be a checkbox. It's a boolean.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Okay. That makes
Fred Demargne: So when you know when we know which one a signator is and whenever a document is to be signed for
Ghiles Moussaoui: sense.
Fred Demargne: this entity then automatically it send the uh it trigger the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: signature process for each of those user for the same
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Here uh there is a couple of questions. For example, right? There is members of an entity and there is um also the user types. Um okay user type let's say could be an arranger commercial partner or partner those uh which user type can have individual type and also entity type is it all of them can the CEO for example also be an entity or how does it work is it restricted to
 
 
00:44:03
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: specific
Fred Demargne: actually the CEO is today an entity because there are it's a it's it's a it's a company every time and there there are more than one there is for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: most documentation we kept Julian as a as a signator but yes it's not Julian who is signing it's Julian as the manager of an
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But the user I mean because we will have people that will log into the platform that will create an account. Right. When we talk about CEO, can there be multiple users, right? Multiple accounts,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: so to say, multiple emails, multiple passwords that log in and as user as CEO and what changes from one
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to the other, is it the same or how does it go? Like is
Fred Demargne: Let's give an example.
Ghiles Moussaoui: there
Fred Demargne: So you know we're going to when we launch we have one issuer one CEO company which is Verso Capital.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: Verso Capital will have probably three users Julian, myself and Ashish.
 
 
00:45:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So uh Julian is the only only one that can sign documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. This is right
Fred Demargne: Uh but but we the other ones we need to be we need to be able to do thing as a
Ghiles Moussaoui: now.
Fred Demargne: CEO in in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. I understand this.
Fred Demargne: platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What I wanted and the followup question is is it only for signatures that it differs from you know the CEO activities is there other stuff um let's say some account in the CEO can't do something or how does it
Fred Demargne: I think for the I think for the CEO.
Ghiles Moussaoui: go
Fred Demargne: No, I think for the CEO we should have all the same right. The only difference is the signature.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay and for the other um accounts. Um
Fred Demargne: So for the other accounts there are different things because you have access to reporting,
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: access to data room. Um so potentially anybody who signed the NDA no whoever can sign the NDA is a signatory for the entity but uh any user under this entity could be able to access data room if they are so the
 
 
00:46:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah, obviously.
Fred Demargne: access of data room is a bit different but it it's it's going to be open so to for the data
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: room to be accessible All the users who are signatory for an entity needs to have signed
Ghiles Moussaoui: All the users. Okay. Does that mean a For example,
Fred Demargne: by
Ghiles Moussaoui: an investor, right? Investor can have multiple members. Can they have multiple signaries like people that
Fred Demargne: if it's an entity with more than one signature.
Ghiles Moussaoui: sign? So,
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: does that mean every single one has to have an NDA generated automatically with their metadata, which means their name, address,
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: and email um accordingly?
Fred Demargne: Yeah. And in that case,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: in that case, be careful. The the name and address is the address of the company, not their individual address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh okay. Yes. If it is entity type. Yes. Okay. Um
 
 
00:47:29
 
Fred Demargne: So it would be an NDA edited uh for a company and and and I think the easiest way is I mean there are two ways to look at it or you you you have an one
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: NDA for that entity with a multiple signatures or you have as many NDA for this entity as you have signatures.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah I mean I think as many NDAs um as you have signitories just the multiple NDAs. Yeah, I mean the same address which is entity address but for the other placeholders in the NDA there will be some
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: other
Fred Demargne: but for the subscription document, for the subscription pack, it needs to be one pack with multiple scenarios.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah okay so multiple signatures through the document or how does it go because right now uh when it's done automatically but I have to define a page to the pixel level where the document the signature will be put in there. For now there is one and they have to define it somewhere in the document maybe the last page or the third page where the signature um you know column or like place has to be printed there.
 
 
00:48:49
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is how we need this.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So the so the template of the document will have placeholders where the signature needs to be uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: inserted but there will be more than one signature because there will be more than one signature.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, we have to define multiple places where the signature will be put.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. You didn't see Julian didn't share with you the template.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, I I have examples of subscription packs. I'm not sure if um they have I think it it was the same um signature everywhere like one
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So he didn't share with you an example.
Ghiles Moussaoui: signature.
Fred Demargne: So it's just going to be underneath. So you have you imagine there's pages. I don't know if you want to show to me, but you imagine there this this signature page. So instead of having one so you you have different blocks and then each
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: block uh will represent the investor one block will represent the arranger another block will represent the uh what we call the CEO.
 
 
00:49:53
 
Fred Demargne: So in in in each of those blocks then the system needs to request whether there is one
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: sy or more and if there is more then you need to have each
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: of them on the same line or underneath to to each other.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see my screen? I think um Julian shared this with me for example subscription pack example right so when I go down uh okay there is all of this there is Julian
Fred Demargne: Yeah, the CEO.
Ghiles Moussaoui: signature um yeah CEO
Fred Demargne: So that would be the CEO here. This one
Ghiles Moussaoui: signature here as well and when I go
Fred Demargne: is
Ghiles Moussaoui: down there is Julian Julian and the person
Fred Demargne: here. So here instead so under the subscriber if the subscriber is an entity with multiple signatures where you will have the first one the block here with a name and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: title and then underneath you will have another block with the name and title etc
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: etc on as many senatories as you
 
 
00:51:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: have.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Typically, what is the how many do you have?
Fred Demargne: Uh, you need a maximum. Is that what you mean? What you're asking
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I'm just thinking of how to structure because how I put it as templates is HTML templates for
Fred Demargne: or
Ghiles Moussaoui: the documents, right? And it has condition. Let's say you will send in an array if the array of signitories it say is greater than maybe five here, then it will have to create another page for it. So it doesn't overlap with other elements and it doesn't look weird.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I think we should to to be safe, we should put a maximum of 10 maybe, but more likely it will be two or
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Another thing for subscription pack is that it doesn't generate um a subscription
Fred Demargne: three.
Ghiles Moussaoui: pack final. It does that with the NDA right now. But NDA because I think it's stable. But when I talked to Julian, he said, "Okay, subscription pack uh it's better to not generate it um entirely, but you generate a draft for the person because many closes will have to be changed or like reviewed by from the lawyer and it will be you know dynamic to
 
 
00:52:16
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: the
Fred Demargne: that that is not the rule. That is I mean I will call him again but that's that if you think
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I mean what he said is correct but if you think you are building a platform that's not correct because here what we are trying to do is to make it as standard as possible. So what we want is as soon as the investor say I want to invest $1
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: million he clicks on it if all the checks that we have done
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: before are okay then immediately it's it's generating the subscription pack and then once we have the subscription pack then this is when so
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it's after you receive the first version of the pack that we might have those conversation that Julian
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: mentioned to you whereby the where uh Um uh the other party will have some comments but but for the other party to have some comments we need to share a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So,
 
 
00:53:15
 
Fred Demargne: first
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. Yeah. For now it is it generates a draft.
Fred Demargne: one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Draft is sent for CEO or um the person the user that is responsible for managing uh that specifically and then they can upload the final version or mark this as the final version and then click ready for signature which will send it for to be signed from investor and also CEO currently. Uh which means
Fred Demargne: Okay. I need to I need to ask Julian because that's not correct
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: because if we need to if we need to sign every document
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah,
Fred Demargne: manually
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean no that is not the thing. The document sign in if it is uh you know static to Julian I can just put Julie's signature you know programmed and directly every time document is generated is autosigned directly with a signature of Julian. Um, what I'm thinking of is is is it better to be done that way or is it better to sign every time just for I don't know formal reasons or I don't know.
 
 
00:54:24
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, that is not the an issue I think it's more an
Fred Demargne: No, legally legally is not an issue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: issue.
Fred Demargne: The issue is if Julian wants I mean the signature is not the problem. The problem is that we need to click on one button. If we need to click on one button every time that the pack is is generated then we are losing the vision of what we want to achieve.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: Um having said that obviously it's possible that the the first version of subscription pack will not be uh the final one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So we need to have a possibility to update the subscription pack but but the first
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: version of the pack you will not know the comments that the other party has until you share a further
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: version. So I don't understand the point of creating a draft for the CEO to incorporate comments that he has not received
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah,
Fred Demargne: yet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: what I thought is for specific closures closes I don't really know which ones but they are very dynamic from one example to another which means it's not specific text with placeholders that I can inject ject data in but there's also specific wording or specific sometimes there is more clauses um in these specifically so sometimes it's different right and we need a standard template I mean I understand what you mean yeah so standard
 
 
00:55:53
 
Fred Demargne: Exactly. And we have we have a standard template because I'm writing those document myself often as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah okay Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So we have a standard template and it's true that for in some cases but that's not the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: that's not the rule.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Then we have more sophisticated investors who actually request
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: additional closes which we which we uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Again.
Fred Demargne: which we we accept to uh to do you know uh because if they want to invest lots of money we are fine.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Got it. Yeah. Um Okay. Okay, can you share with me the templates for both certificate because what I have from Julian is examples and I created a template myself from okay what changes what doesn't change um both for you know NDA um subscription pack agreement and also the certificate and if there is any other document as
Fred Demargne: Okay. can you send me what you have and I will build a template because a template is not only about
 
 
00:56:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh.
Fred Demargne: showing what the basic wording is is also to identify the fields and to tell you which fields correspond to what. So I can do that if you send me the template the the template that you used so
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh.
Fred Demargne: far or the example from Julian and I will I will check whether it's correct or not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: and then I will I will use the right template and I will specify which field with what in the field that needs to be populated which fields correspond to what instance here if you look
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um, so what Julian shared with me?
Fred Demargne: at the first page the logo versus logo logo is a dynamic field.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay, it needs to be the logo of the um compartment of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: The company.
Fred Demargne: series.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. This Yeah.
Fred Demargne: The second thing versus capital 2 SCSP series 206 is a dynamic
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: field.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I know.
Fred Demargne: Entropic entropic AI is an is also a dynamic field.
 
 
00:57:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Fred Demargne: preferred stock is also a dynamic field because it could be common stock, it could be many different things.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Where
Fred Demargne: So the logo underneath of entropic is a dynamic field.
Ghiles Moussaoui: where
Fred Demargne: So you know in the first page there is already many dynamic fields.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um so okay this is already done as dynamic. So obviously this um this anthropic is AI preferred stock but this is
Fred Demargne: So where where who who who who who where where in the platform do you define
Ghiles Moussaoui: not
Fred Demargne: preference
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh it is directly used as the name of the series or like the name of investment opportunity
Fred Demargne: stock?
Ghiles Moussaoui: inside the series. So if it is uh you know 215 then it is associated with entropic then anthropic will be preferred stock here. If it is 206 it will be open i. So it's basically to the series and the name here as well is um you know
Fred Demargne: So it shouldn't be in a series because in the in the same pack you refer to preferred stock at several places without the name entropic AI.
 
 
00:59:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, but anthropic AI is what?
Fred Demargne: So preferred stock. So so preferred stock needs to be a specific field on it on its
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: own because I think it's going is used in a different place different
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: places.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And where do I get the data when it's done automatically? Where should be a preferred stock here? Um
Fred Demargne: So the the CEO when he create the investment opportunity he should say this
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: is vessel capital 2 SCSP 215 they should say that the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: company which is an underlying company is entropic AI you should say that the type of of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: shares that the investor will invest in is preferred stock so it's a field that the CEO needs to insert when he creates the investment opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So I don't know if you looked at how it is created right now it's called the deals
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: but when I create a when I create a deal I have to I I can choose to select a vehicle which is a series right I can select the series number
 
 
01:00:19
 
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: from there it will spring all of the information from the series which means investment name and maybe other things will maybe description um investment t name the logo as well will come from there and it will basically go to the opportunity um investment uh opportunity which means the logo if it is already inside the series we don't have to put it again the name investment name is miss uh is also anthropic we don't have to put it again you can put a different name from for the deal the investment opportunity but the investment opportunity from investment name from um the series already it's it's coming from the table to the new table which is for the investment opportunities directly and this preferred stock. This is for me the same thing as the name of the investment which is opportunity uh which is anthropic unless you want when um the CEO creates new investment opportunity they would put every single you know things that has to change for example here is anthropic AI but here is anthropic uh BPC so I'm not sure where BBC is
 
 
01:01:31
 
Fred Demargne: Under the same under the same vehicle you can have multiple
Ghiles Moussaoui: coming
Fred Demargne: stock.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um Sorry.
Fred Demargne: Under the same vehicle you can have multiple type of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh yeah,
Fred Demargne: stock.
Ghiles Moussaoui: but it will have a specific name, right? Uh for now, series 215 is for enthropic or is there at the any other stock because I defaulted to the dashboard and also a list that Julian shared with me with all of the entities I mean series that uh there is. There is two and one I think also the real estate. So I just took every all of that turned it into a table in database. I can show you if you want.
Fred Demargne: So now if I just explain to you so series 215 will only be about entropic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: It can be a bit entropic about common stock or it can be about entropic in preferred stock or it can be around entropic in series B stock. They could be however we want. So at the the underlying company of series 215 is always the same.
 
 
01:02:44
 
Fred Demargne: The type of investment under series 215 can be different from one invest from one investment opportunity to another because each series can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: open and close and reopen and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Uh I think it's better if we go to it right
Fred Demargne: close.
Ghiles Moussaoui: now. Okay. So when I go to entities which is series right I can see the series that there is right when I scroll down. Can you see my screen? All right.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I can see him.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So when I scroll down to 20110 space X perplexity open AI revolute and anthropic right this is a series it has uh these fields. So it has the name. So there is the code there is uh the code uh I just got it from the table that was shared with me. So there is name investment platform the type um status investment. So how many investors sorry open flags this is the health it tracks the health of each entity based on the list that has to be uh finished activity currency reporting so there's this reporting company and online but when I go down for an example to 15 anropic say I want to open it I have this.
 
 
01:04:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So here I have the virtual capital is also the series name. Um I have the overview information complete information about entity.
Fred Demargne: So, so here,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the name entity you told
Fred Demargne: so here we need to get rid of entity. No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: me before you told me it's not entity it's not entities it's series I believe. Is that correct?
Fred Demargne: I need to check with Julian if you want to call it because it's not always series. Sometime it's compartment. So maybe we don't need to give a name.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I mean this is the main name right? You can just change this as the type.
Fred Demargne: Yes. Maybe entity details,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh could be yeah this is just text
Fred Demargne: you just say details. That's it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: so it can be edited would be a
Fred Demargne: And then and then and then instead of entity,
Ghiles Moussaoui: problem.
Fred Demargne: we need to say uh maybe vehicle is the right terms.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Vehicle vehicle is
 
 
01:05:30
 
Fred Demargne: Vehicles. Vehicles maybe is going to be easier because it could be whatever we want,
Ghiles Moussaoui: fine.
Fred Demargne: you know. It can be a series. It can be a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, before it was in the database I you know I started it with vehicle because when Julian explain was
Fred Demargne: compartment
Ghiles Moussaoui: explaining to me all of it was you can see vehicles but he told me okay I think it's better to put it as entities. So we changed it just in the UI to look uh you know the name to entities.
Fred Demargne: okay of entity is I mean the only issue of entity that it refers to two different
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: things which have nothing to do That's that's why we need to select him.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah got it. Yep.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh so this is metadata doicile doicile
Fred Demargne: But so here look here the problem is uh the address here that you put is for what?
Ghiles Moussaoui: is for the I think do see um so the address of maybe entity or the holding company or
 
 
01:06:32
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So that's kind of I think I think here is is the address of the of the company on tropic
Ghiles Moussaoui: depending you know yeah this is what
Fred Demargne: and it cannot be here. So we need to have a separate table about the company which is an underlying company where you can collect the
Ghiles Moussaoui: events.
Fred Demargne: name of the company on tropic the address but the address of the vehicle the vehicle has nothing to do with the address of the underlying
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: company.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get it. For now, this is uh for the the company and anthropic. So, doicile here is for anthropic. It's not for the entity or like vehicle by itself.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's a legal thing. I think
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So yeah. So you need to have two different table database for the the underlying company and
Ghiles Moussaoui: right
Fred Demargne: you need to have a database for the vehicle which you already have for the vehicle but you need to because we need to have this information but not to display it here.
 
 
01:07:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay here for example there's uh an issue that could add complexity right because I use this table to for you know the address here created type you can see all of the you know the name doic seal currency created I type uh this is venture capital cavity SPV fund and all um registration number legal jurisdiction entity code um platform
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: so this is VC1 SCSP uh investment name former entity this is from the table the status live close or to be determined Reporting type required reporting logo URL website service name service short title issuer
Fred Demargne: Where did you get all
Ghiles Moussaoui: issue. Um so the the website for example it will be done uh it will
Fred Demargne: this?
Ghiles Moussaoui: be given in the beginning when you create one right.
Fred Demargne: Anyway,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,
Fred Demargne: where did you create those fields? Where where do they come from? Is it you or is it
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh, no. So, if I can register right now,
Fred Demargne: Julian?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can show you what Julian shared with me before because we were initially working on automations.
 
 
01:08:48
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, yeah, we were initially working on automations, not on the platform. Um, so I got to find the kernel thing. no main entities. So this comes from here initially. So this is uh it was this um CSV in Excel shot by Julian and they imported it here. So it looks like this most of these. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I can give you access to this as well if you prefer.
Fred Demargne: What is your Can you go on the right hand side?
Ghiles Moussaoui: the right.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Stop. Stop here. So, first name, last name.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh, just move a little bit on the left. Sorry. And just to have the first name and the last
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay. these um if I remember it is for
Fred Demargne: name
Ghiles Moussaoui: specific people that are um I think they're responsible for specific type of reporting. uh if there is quarterly or monthly reporting this is the person that you would uh contact to get specific information that the investor requested I think for the specific data room uh in the portfolio if I'm not wrong.
 
 
01:10:19
 
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: I mean, I think the only issue I see with the terminology here is investment because to call
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: investment a company, it's a bit weird because we're going to call in the investment portfolio that we discussed yesterday.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: We're going to use also investment and here it will not refer to the company where they invested they invested in but how much money they invested in a particular
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: company.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean there is uh there is some complexity here because there is this is vehicle this is like legal entities um this is a series right if
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you go to deals the deals you can see there's multiple tables for tracking the deals which is investment opportunity right so the data documents deal subscriptions so this is the deals when you create an investment opportunity it will be registered here and then this will become a subscription which is let's say same thing as investment which tracks okay the ID of it the investor ID the vehicle ID uh which so it which from which um sorry from which investment entity or from which vehicle it's coming from and you know the commitment the currency the status this is for the investment phase or like journey and then there is position so position is when it is uh The investment is active which means it is fully funded.
 
 
01:11:52
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will create a position and the position is for now simple. So just units cost and last now as of
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I I understand.
Ghiles Moussaoui: date.
Fred Demargne: I just that you hear in your sentences you use investment for different things and I think that's the problem.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Um okay. So investment I think is the process how we think about
Fred Demargne: is a company. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: Investment should be the process. I agree.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And
Fred Demargne: Investment process. And when and and in what you were showing me before,
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay
Fred Demargne: investment should be the company.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um okay so the company for me is the investment name. Um how I think about it okay there is the series that has a company right that you can invest in. I think he told me it can be multiple stocks. So which means could be multiple companies. I'm not sure if there is a fund and um from there you can create an investment opportunity for that specific series.
 
 
01:12:55
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So vehicle an investment opportunity you can name it however you want but the investment um name from the name of the vehicle comes from there. So if in the vehicle you called it enthropic um as the investment then the investment opportunity will also be enthropic. If you remember in the active deals it's named anthropic openi perplexity directly right there is no name or like there is no big name for the series name like the code uh for the investor and the investment for me it's a process which includes okay first the vehicle and then the investment opportunity that you create from the vehicle and then the subscription phase which means after the subscription is signed that is created it tracks Okay. If the money arrives, it is partially funded. If it is fully funded, if they signed the subscription agreement and when it is active, which is fully funded, then it becomes a a position. A position, which means okay, it's in the portfolio. This is how uh I thought about it when I created this.
Fred Demargne: there that's that's more accurate accurate.
 
 
01:14:08
 
Fred Demargne: So the the only problem is the definition of the vehicle vehicle and then the the first stage this is the issue here the investment name is not entropic uh you are not only investing in entropic you are investing in a particular product in which represents shares in entropic because we're not nobody is investing directly into the cap table of a of a company here we are they are investing through to us which then we will have a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: position in the cap table of entropic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I think it's misleading to say that they investing into intropic. No they are investing in uh preferred stock of entropic in vers 2 a CSP series 215.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I mean actually they're not they're not just for you to understand they're not buying
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I understand.
Fred Demargne: shares.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand the um Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You're buying certificates, not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yes. So this is legal part and
Fred Demargne: shares.
Ghiles Moussaoui: so this is the overview of it and I think I should continue maybe a little bit show you here and then I will go to deals and uh or like I can go directly.
 
 
01:15:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I create a new deal here you can see um there is deal name. So which is investment opportunity right name the deals but they will change it which is okay deal name company name if it is a company
Fred Demargne: So here should be our
Ghiles Moussaoui: um yeah so see there is entity optional
Fred Demargne: topic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: when I click on it I can go below and choose um 2015 which is anthropic right for 2016 not entropic but preferred stock entropic right
Fred Demargne: Yeah. But here I think uh if I understood what Julian explained to me here entity means something else. So what Julian asked if again it depends on whether I understood well what Julian told
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: me but the entity cannot be
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think he told me it can be optional because it could be for example if uh there is
Fred Demargne: optional.
Ghiles Moussaoui: no series and you want to create a deal in maybe something new real estate or personal trading, raise capital or anything. You can do that directly
 
 
01:16:41
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: here.
Fred Demargne: uh there will still be an entity in every
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um an
Fred Demargne: case there will be an entity even if it's real estate if it's trading whatever it
Ghiles Moussaoui: entity.
Fred Demargne: is they will be an entity so then I'm not sure we are referring to the same thing they should
Ghiles Moussaoui: So entity here is vehicle.
Fred Demargne: be I mean it doesn't matter because
Ghiles Moussaoui: This should be required.
Fred Demargne: it's us the CEO who defines it but Yeah, it is required because otherwise you told me before the logo of the when you create
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: an opportunity lots of things are coming from the vehicle.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So if you
Ghiles Moussaoui: But you can Yeah.
Fred Demargne: don't
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you don't put the vehicle, you can put the logo by yourself. Uh so it's not predetermined that uh so know if there is a
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: logo in the entity then yeah if there is not then you can just put it here and okay so create a
 
 
01:17:39
 
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: deal here there is a simple data let's say you put in or you don't put in the vehicle um so this and then the next stage is the currency uh target amount um maximum investment, minimum investment, price per share and then finally you have the open date so to have a timeline for it etc. description and investment thesis. So this is the basic when you create a new investment opportunity and basically the um it's connected from here when you want to connect it to a specific vehicle or like series or something like that and then so without without creating a new one you would have uh created something that looks
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: like this. So here it is um an investment opportunity. This is not a series nor uh a vehicle so to say but an investment opportunity. And here I think we went through this yesterday where there is the overview investment thesis uh term sheet if you remember interests data room and all of that.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah and in the database it is linked to the ID to the investment uh so the investment opportunity is linked to the vehicles so that then you can have data okay which vehicle has most of the subscriptions or um most of the investment opportunities from which vehicle or like where do investors prefer to subscribe or something like that.
 
 
01:19:27
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can have you can make sense of the data and you can link it to have a data pipeline. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay. So that makes sense.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, it makes sense. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So I think we can cover we can come back to uh this Yeah. So this for the vehicle for the information right. So there is the logo here you can see the branding um for anthropic um the investors this is basic investor um record with how much they invested documents and folders this structures the folders and the documents of the
Fred Demargne: Are you sure?
Ghiles Moussaoui: specific series or vehicle for naming um stakeholders. So yeah, stakeholders, we didn't define it yet. Directors,
Fred Demargne: But what does that mean? This
Ghiles Moussaoui: stakeholders, I think um can be lawyer, accountant, audit administrator, strategic,
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, this needs to
Ghiles Moussaoui: shareholder.
Fred Demargne: be this needs to be at the company level, not at the vehicle level.
 
 
01:21:06
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: to add the stakeholder.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. the stakeholder on the vehicle level doesn't make any sense.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: So what you need to have is at the company level you have stakeholders,
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.
Fred Demargne: you have directors, whoever you want. Uh they represent the company here it's entropic.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So then because the Siri 215 is associated to entropic as a company then the information is directly accessible. There is a link but the link is you have a table database for the company which is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: on tropic and then underneath that company you have different type of people who could be
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: involved. Uh at the moment I don't think we're going to create a user for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: them. So it's going to be a static name.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh but moving forward we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. For now, um, we didn't get to it.
Fred Demargne: could.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think we didn't develop it but so yeah to their questions we need to add the table that connects to the vehicle that expands the company uh if it is a company
 
 
01:22:19
 
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um because right now it is directly in one table.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Okay. So directors what do you think about directors? Is it the same
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: thing?
Fred Demargne: director should be uh I understand director of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, stakeholders,
Fred Demargne: company.
Ghiles Moussaoui: directors, um this is the deals that you have created. And there is a health bar which is a couple of information. If you uh didn't put information, it prompts you to do it. And just Julian told me add this feature. So, I added it. What? what is missing what kind of information to have the entity let's say fully um compliant or I'm not sure how to name it. So there is the activity log um valuations uh valuations I think on the company level as well right?
Fred Demargne: valuation is about the company.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Positions.
Fred Demargne: I don't know what position stand for here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Positions is what will the customers or like investor in this case see in their um portfolio.
 
 
01:23:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So they have a position after they um the subscription is fully funded. It becomes a position and you can see information here.
Fred Demargne: So here for the CEO you will have all the investor with their corresponding positions.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Is that is that what you meant?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yes. So position is is on the vehicle and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Got it. Um that makes sense.
Fred Demargne: but why do you have investors in you see you have overview and then you have investors.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Which is just um investors like who
Fred Demargne: So what is the difference between investors and positions?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Investors gives you more information about the investor. This for currently right this can be um you can see the stat is committed not fully funded. So it only becomes a position which is fully funded.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So right now the subscription is committed which means they did not pay they just signed the subscription. they are in the stage of investment where they have to send the money partially or fully and then it goes through the the reconciliations um to make sure that the invoice so to say is fully matched.
 
 
01:25:00
 
Fred Demargne: So instead of invest of investor it should be subscriptions. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah I mean the terminology I guess there subscriptions make more sense. Yes.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So position in that sense is after the submit the subscription process ended then the investor invested in the portfolio in the in their in the company and therefore it becomes a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: position. So in you should have subscription which is a current flow you know the pipeline of the subscription process and then once you get to funded then it should
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: automatically be updated into position I
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: suppose.
Ghiles Moussaoui: That's how it's um looking like right now. how it's work it works.
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um any other question regarding should I go through more things that we did not cover I think yesterday maybe the
Fred Demargne: For me, for me, if we go bit by bit,
Ghiles Moussaoui: reconciliations
Fred Demargne: what I would like is to adjust the the data model for the entities what we discussed.
 
 
01:26:09
 
Fred Demargne: Um uh so as you explained so there would be database for investor, database for uh partner, database for introducer, database for uh lawyer, database for aranger, database for CEO if I understand what you
Ghiles Moussaoui: No,
Fred Demargne: explained.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think not database but user type in the profiles and a table specifically for them. Yeah. to to be able to cut the to be I think it's better done like that instead of doing everything from scratch because if I edit the investor table or the other table everything would be broken so it would have to reconstitute
Fred Demargne: No, I mean I I meant a table.
Ghiles Moussaoui: every
Fred Demargne: Yes. So you keep a table for investor and then you create new tables for the other
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: types.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: No, I think we need to be to make to go for simple things.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think that would be more simple. Uh I'm I'm I'm not sure but I think that would be more simple because if I edit the investors table currently that is a table and changes to users or accounts or what what uh makes more sense then um the subscription flow will be broken because it will allow anyone and they have to create restrictions there and the documents will be broken.
 
 
01:27:40
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: um positions also the investment opportunity to be able to track it. The approvals would be broken. Messages wouldn't make sense because it's only for the investor uh for now. Um yeah, the fees would be broken. So many things would be broken. So it's better to add a table after table and make sense for each table and have it as uh because you also told me they would have uh they could have an entity and also or individual right because there is some complexity there. They would have members as well. So if commercial partner is a bank it's an entity they have members and those members would have an account. So if you consolidate everything in one table for the arrangers, the CEO and everything instead of you know investors just change it into uh what is the name again users then I think yeah one table it will be too dense and it will use
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: multiple type types because it will be investor and investor member type right one investor because investor could be an individual entity and the person can be a member of that entity, right?
 
 
01:28:56
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So then there will be a little bit more complexity and everything will be I mean not everything but a lot of
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: things would have to be redone like the KYC rely on that table many things rely on the table. Um you can see if I go to the database uh I go to the positions I can see so investor ID uh if I go to the subscriptions is the same. So subscriptions um investor ID um I think KYC similarly submissions. So investor ID. Yeah. And yeah, I think most of the other things. Yeah. So investor ID is because it was built for mainly customer, you know, facing customer. How we thought about it before is okay, we would create either completely new portals for the uh new members. Uh could be you know the lawyer would have their own portal. the other people to have the main portal and maybe stuff would be you know a CEO or CEO portal or an admin portal and so we would add on top of what we have but now we will have to change many things to uh have it work.
 
 
01:30:22
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay. Okay. Do you have any other question or should we cover more ground here?
Fred Demargne: Can you remind me the investor counterparty? Can you reexlain?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um if you remember. Okay. What is it again?
Fred Demargne: the investor. You need to choose investor and then
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: counterparty.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So entity investors um investor counterparty this right.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. What is it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if you remember uh yesterday we went to the profile of the investor and there there was entities there which is like counterparties if they want to invest through a trust fund or like some other entity but not them you know their entity specifically or maybe it's an individual that wants to invest through a trust and they can add that entity they will need to add their KYC KYC has to be approved and then They can use that with their information you know with the
Fred Demargne: What is what is the difference between an entity as an investor
 
 
01:31:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: entry.
Fred Demargne: and an investor counterparty?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Counterparty is a third party. It's not the entity itself. It's not the investor. It's a trust to the investor or some other company they want to use. Um entity investors is the uh entity investors. This is vehicle investors which means it connects the investors here. This uh investors uses the connection between the uh investors and the vehicle ID. Um yeah, that's basically it. And they think because the logic is one investor can have multiple subscriptions in one vehicle, right? Which means then you want one recard because otherwise it is tracked elsewhere in the subscriptions. Every time the investor subscribed uh to an investment opportunity through that vehicle is already stored in the subscriptions table. So here you just want one row. If any time it happened, it's uh you know
Fred Demargne: I'm sorry I I didn't catch this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: here.
Fred Demargne: Can you say differently the difference between entity as an investor and an investor counterparty? Because a trust for me the example you say it's a it's an entity where
 
 
01:33:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: uh actually usually in a trust the actual UBO or the trust is not there. So you will have administrators which will sign a document for the trust. But for me this is an entity as an
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um Okay.
Fred Demargne: investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is not I think the it diverged. So an investor can be an entity can be individual. If they are an entity or an individual they can connect they can add another entity to them. So an investor is an entity but they can add the counterparty maybe for lawyers or like u investment firm that uh would help them to do the documentation. I'm not sure. I think Julian told me that he told me that when we were doing uh the subscription pack workflow, he said when when an investor um fills in the information to submit for a subscription pack, they need to be able to invest through a third party entity which is not themselves. They regardless if they are um an individual or an entity.
 
 
01:34:14
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um but to be able to do that they need to create a counterparty which is like entity he called it entity. So to make u because there is database thing they called it called it counterparty and they have to have their KYC and
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but uh if I from what you explaining me there is no difference between an entity and an investor counterparty.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um
Fred Demargne: is just a different way to create the entity but then it's in both cases this is an entity you collect KYC of the entity the entity
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: is investing not the individual person so for me there is we don't need to have those two things unless there is a difference
Ghiles Moussaoui: Well, it there is a difference to database. uh if you add them as an investor entity then it comes that ent like it's like you have two investors um accounts that refer to one one that use another company to invest through them or to do maybe paperwork for them if there is a law firm or uh something like that.
 
 
01:35:27
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So that's how I thought about it. Um, from what Julian explained to
Fred Demargne: But so but but what is a what you just explained what is the difference with an entity?
Ghiles Moussaoui: me,
Fred Demargne: So imagine uh it's me want to invest and I've got several vehicle that I want to use to invest. Each vehicle is a company. No. So let's call it I'm call I'm calling Fred one SPV,
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah,
Fred Demargne: Fred 2 SPV, Fred 3 SPV. Each of those companies are entities. So they can have me or not me as a senator.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh then they will in those entity will invest in an investment opportunity uh with one subscription document with multiple senatories. Um that's an entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So this is a company uh this investment counterparty is it's like saying uh this is the vehicle that the investor is using to you know subscribe through could be multiple
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but that's an entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: companies.
Fred Demargne: That's an entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:36:27
 
Fred Demargne: So is that we need you need to and that's that's a point that I was mentioning before when we started to talk about entity each. So for each entity you don't have an entity account. You have an entity and each entity has different user accounts associated to each
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um that's where uh it's a little bit confusing.
Fred Demargne: entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is the investor that can have multiple user accounts but the entity is just legal structure that you create and you add their documentation without them having their member there is their members as well um but they don't have users for now what you're mentioning is one user can have access to multiple investor accounts which is the companies or like the entities is that what you mean is what do you
Fred Demargne: Now what I mean is one user. So each entity needs to have an user account.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So if it's not the case then we need to build this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: H entity.
Fred Demargne: So why?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Because we don't want to create an entity account.
 
 
01:37:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: Okay? We don't want to create complexity by having an entity account. An entity is a structure is a legal structure which uh invests in different investment opportunity but underneath that legal structure you have people signing information and they have people having an account in our platform. So for instance imagine Fred one SPV is an entity and I've got three people in it and two signaturies. So, I got Fred as a senior as a as a UBO. I've got uh my my son Gregory as a UBO for instance, and I've got another a lawyer as a as a member of the entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So, Fred and Gregory will have a user account in the platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: Fred and Gregory will be able to invest individually or will be able to invest through this entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So when they invest through this entity this because we have their account associated to this entity. So whenever they say I am interested to invest in $1 million in a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
 
 
01:38:44
 
Fred Demargne: company then because there is user account is associated to the entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: This is the entity investing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: If we I don't know if it's easy or not, but you could imagine that Fred wants to invest alone sometimes. So either he needs to have another account with another email, that would be the simplest way for us or we can say that Fred uh with the same email, same user account can invest either through an entity or himself, which is which is I think what Julian kind of mixed up and and and said to you. Well, you have entity and then you investor a counterparty because the investor decide to invest through a company or himself. But for me,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: a counterparty is an entity the whether we want
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: so then it's a different way to to name it but it's it's a complexity which is useless I think. So the only thing that we need to decide and and maybe your input in terms of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:39:53
 
Fred Demargne: complexity needs to be taken into account is whether the same user account would be able to invest in as a uh with an entity or
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: or as an individual or if we want to force the system to request the user to if he wants to invest under an entity it's one account with one email address or if he wants to invest himself, it's another account with another email
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. For now it is in the investor,
Fred Demargne: address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? Investor portal. When you go to I am inside the portal of the investor. Um when I go to entities, I see this, right? So I can create another entity which is as like a legal third party company could be trust could be anything. So entity type you can see here or from family office fund you put the basic information. Um so registered address stuff that you would need
Fred Demargne: So those are those are entities or
Ghiles Moussaoui: to this is the same counterparty is the terminology in the
 
 
01:40:58
 
Fred Demargne: counterparty.
Ghiles Moussaoui: database. This is the entity.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Yes,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: that's correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You would put the address, CD. Uh so basic information authorized representative so directors maybe and then um you would have to so there is members KYC. So once you create it you have the details the members that you can add right um full name okay user email and stuff. for now it does not invite the member. So um and I guess we would need to add the boolean if they are assign you know person that sign documents or don't and yeah and then they have the QC documents.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So for me,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: for me I don't know if you want to have in technically the two the two terminology but I think we agree now what you are showing me is good. It's an entity. Okay. So it shouldn't be in the user in the in the in the front
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:42:09
 
Fred Demargne: end. We should never have investor counterparty.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's called counterbody entities here in the
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: UI.
Fred Demargne: Well, we can call this but what is important is it's the same thing as entity as an investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: There is no difference whatsoever between entity as an investor and what before was called in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: a database investor counterparty. So in a data model we need to have one con one
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: table with the the entities and for each entity you need to have the different users with their user accounts and you need to have you know the registered address of the entity as you were showing me uh all the registration number of the comp of the of the entity the KYC document of the entity And then at the individual user will receive the KYC of the user. So for an entity for Fred one SPV with Fred me being a member of the SPV in the in the table of the of Fred documents
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
 
 
01:43:24
 
Fred Demargne: there will be my proof of address and my proof of ID and under the company uh KYC document table there will be the company
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: documents and for each
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's already established uh for now. It
Fred Demargne: user for each member of an entity you need to know if they are signatures or
Ghiles Moussaoui: just Yeah, for now it's not, but uh signature is new, so we'll add
Fred Demargne: I don't think tax ID.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: Uh tax ID. Tax ID. Yeah, tax ID. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah. Okay. So, it's here when I
Fred Demargne: So, where did you get uh these fields here that you created?
Ghiles Moussaoui: click
Fred Demargne: Where where is it? You or is it Julian who told you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh Julian showed me the I think I see list. This if I can zoom in if you if you prefer.
Fred Demargne: So here I don't see tax
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: ID.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I was about to show you that was static when I created it.
 
 
01:44:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It wasn't. Uh so I would remove this. It's here.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The documents are here. Um so selecting custom NDA um document type this is because it's entity you have all the document types and then you can select the member that is related to it and then you have to give the documents um for a specific member and also specific entity.
Fred Demargne: So here in this in this um can we customize the the
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you would put
Fred Demargne: the how do you call this the the menu so that uh for document type here you only see the relevant type of document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So questionnaire I don't think it is KYC but I understood it as
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: KYC but they would remove it. There is yeah incorporation um should
Fred Demargne: should not be. No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: not Okay.
Fred Demargne: it's not a document type for KYC.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But uh what about this? So for entities NDA and and
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but that's not a that's a that's a mistake.
 
 
01:45:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: DNC
Fred Demargne: It's not a KYC and NDA. you it's um uh it's part of the investment opportunity when they if you want an investor to um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh look at documentation about a specific investment opportunity you ask him to sign an NDA there will be as many NDA as investment opportunity while the KYC it's only it's the same across any investment opportunity
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this list has to be edited. Where do I get the uh let's say the truth the true
Fred Demargne: I think here it's just NDA and the NC.
Ghiles Moussaoui: list?
Fred Demargne: I think it's a mistake. It just uh went fast. Uh incorporation certificate memory of association register of member register of actor ID for each
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: member. So you see the ID for each member.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is how uh utility bill and ID for each
Fred Demargne: exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: members.
Fred Demargne: confirmation of bank name and jurisdiction to wire funds. Okay, it's not really KYC but it's easier if we have it there are
 
 
01:46:47
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. So when you put on documents you can choose documents that you
Fred Demargne: yes
Ghiles Moussaoui: have um and yeah this is the KYC this is similarly for here when I go to KYC so or can choose documents and select the member because right now I am an individual I cannot select the member it's individual type investor Okay. Any other
Fred Demargne: Instead instead of utility bills,
Ghiles Moussaoui: questions?
Fred Demargne: you need to say proof of address. I don't know how you called it,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: but it's proof of ID and proof of address. And utility bill is one
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: example.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, makes sense.
Fred Demargne: Um so I think you need to do the cleanup for the the entity. You need between the counterparty and the entity. So it should be one thing in the system. I think we need to add the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Fred Demargne: scenaries.
Ghiles Moussaoui: One second. So for now I need to what the first thing I will do is merge both portals, right?
 
 
01:48:06
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: and then I can start doing changes uh editing the database and all because we need uh it's like a foundation to build upon um what
Fred Demargne: Okay, thank
Ghiles Moussaoui: you mean yeah when you said entities and counterparty has to be the same so
Fred Demargne: you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for now it is right now you said here it's accurate but it's not accurate in the database how do you like would anybody work with the database later on or is it just the UI because database has about 90 for now. It will have a little bit more maybe 150 tables uh to make the system work. And does it
Fred Demargne: Yeah, not surprised.
Ghiles Moussaoui: terminology?
Fred Demargne: I think we had 200 tables uh when we did the application. So, not surprised. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So
Fred Demargne: No, so we need to what what I mean is I don't want to have a data data model where we have counterparty and and
Ghiles Moussaoui: that's
Fred Demargne: entity when they are exactly the same. So the naming I don't care uh I I just care about having one table which has all the entity information which links
 
 
01:49:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: to each user
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get it. Okay, I get it.
Fred Demargne: else.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's not uh currently like that because when you say entity for me uh there is no entity there is uh investor and the investor has a type as entity. So the type of investor can be entity and investor counterparties are the entities that are related to the investors that are not investors themselves but it's under the investor it's connected to the investor account which is here that is could be type of individual entity it's named counterparty but it's like third party entities uh you know trust or something like that and you can see in the UI is how this is how it is represented. here as party entities and with the members in the KYC and when you create it you have this form of information. So here
Fred Demargne: so we need to we need to streamline this so that uh maybe you can reuse some of it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay
Fred Demargne: I'm not saying but when an entity invests an entity the entity is the investor not the you not the individual investor associated to the entity so I think what you did here in this table is correct the entity is the investor it's just that at another level when you get when you deep dive into the entity you need to associate to the at to each entity their individual members with their user accounts
 
 
01:50:48
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, there is.
Fred Demargne: So if I if I open bong here,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is in
Fred Demargne: you have the first one bong. I need to see all the users and each users needs to have an
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. So this is investor members.
Fred Demargne: account.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh investor users. So yeah, there is investor members, investor users. Investor users are the ones that already have an account, right? Investor members are the investors are connected. So So ID, investor ID, full name, ro um but like for example here, authorized sign is signatory. This is a guy that signs.
Fred Demargne: It shouldn't be the role. The role should be
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it is investor. It's only investor because it's the table is called investor members. So the role is uh this is just text. So it could be you know um boolean if they are um authorized signatory or not. Ro title is managing partner uh something like that and all
 
 
01:51:51
 
Fred Demargne: Where is where is the entity?
Ghiles Moussaoui: information uh
Fred Demargne: So this is a member of an entity. Which one is the entity
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's connected with this.
Fred Demargne: field?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So entity ID when I click on it it gives me this it's called this is dummy data it's not real but Akma investment yeah type
Fred Demargne: No, it's okay. And why don't you put the actual entity name invest entity name?
Ghiles Moussaoui: entity
Fred Demargne: It will be easier if you add a field here. It's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: but
Fred Demargne: You you need to have the ID because you need to have an index to associate the table.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah but
Fred Demargne: But you need to add another name, another
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,
Fred Demargne: field.
Ghiles Moussaoui: with the ID, I pull all of the informations from the ID, the investor ID when I write the code for the UI. This is why I told you does anybody work with this because um or it's in the UI. If it's in the UI, terminology here only matters for who the one that works with the data model, right?
 
 
01:52:52
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: But for the UI,
Fred Demargne: We might have uh we might have some if we have some issues and we have to be able to identify uh bugs,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: we might have we might have to go to the databases directly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: of course.
Fred Demargne: So as a as a admin so I think I think it's important I think the you absolutely right you need to have the unique ID for the investor to be able to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: associate to it which is here should be the entity ID and not the investor ID I believe unless I'm mistaken but here this is the entity ID
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So there is two um things there is as I said there is investors investors could be an entity right it's called the table is called investor so each row is investor terminology wise and when you go to members it's investor ID investor is an entity when I click on here I can go to legal name directly uh type is entity all right so it's a type the entity for
Fred Demargne: Okay.
 
 
01:53:57
 
Fred Demargne: So it means that for so you will have the same complex you need to duplicate the
Ghiles Moussaoui: And
Fred Demargne: complexity for arranger partner this we will need to
Ghiles Moussaoui: yes,
Fred Demargne: refactor it after the launch.
Ghiles Moussaoui: how come how do you want to structure it?
Fred Demargne: But I think we need to have um user ID or in uh user ID uh in entity ID
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: uh independently of the role they have and then for each uh record there is a role and here the reward can be investor uh um partner introducer lawyer etc etc.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I understand it's too it's it would be too complex to create this uh dependency for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: the launch. So you need to stick to what you say. I think this is the right approach. But I think after that we going to need to do some refactoring because here we are multiplying tables
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah,
Fred Demargne: which we don't need
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't understand. uh what you mean I think I don't see another way to make it
 
 
01:55:01
 
Fred Demargne: to
Ghiles Moussaoui: because um if I make it in one table then just becomes too complex the it won't be a clean way to write a data pipeline I think maybe I'm I'm mistaken maybe I don't understand what you
Fred Demargne: No, I think I think the cleanest way is to have one table for all the users. Whatever the user type is uh whether it's a investor, a lawyer, an aranger or whatever. So you have everything in one table.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: This is all your all your database of users.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. This right now is profiles.
Fred Demargne: Then
Ghiles Moussaoui: So profiles is all the people that have an account and they have the role here. So you can see the role it will be here. So the investor for now it's staff admin but it would be investor CEO and all of the
Fred Demargne: so why is not the entity that you were showing me before linked to the profile
Ghiles Moussaoui: others.
Fred Demargne: ID?
Ghiles Moussaoui: It is linked it's step by step. So user is linked to uh so there is first the authentification that goes through user when users when they create an account.
 
 
01:56:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is authentification when I come.
Fred Demargne: Yes, it's like this is clear. Yeah, this is clear to me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And then um
Fred Demargne: Then it's and then it's the user the actual user of the investor or
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah these are the users.
Fred Demargne: whatever.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I go to users it's a it's like a staging table from the authentification to the database the
Fred Demargne: So the next level,
Ghiles Moussaoui: profiles.
Fred Demargne: the next level after user is
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh pre I think before one second.
Fred Demargne: what
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. User and then there is user investor. I need to change to public user investors and here is just a link between the user and the investor. So a user one investor can have multiple users. This is how it's connected right now. An investor could be an entity type and an investor entity can have a counterparty how I named it in database which is a third party entity that can uh that they can um subscribe through to a specific investment opportunity.
 
 
01:57:46
 
Fred Demargne: And and here it's what relationship is it between the invest investor ID and user ID. It's NN or it's 1 N.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so multiple uh users can have so sorry an entity can have multiple users but not the other way. So N1
Fred Demargne: between the user ID and the investor ID.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah N1. So one entity can have multiple users which is multiple members.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: How I thought about it. So yeah
Fred Demargne: So one investor if it's not an entity can have multiple user
Ghiles Moussaoui: um no no if it's it will have one because it's just individual it's a type
Fred Demargne: So here in this table concretely that you are showing me what is a
Ghiles Moussaoui: um it depends on the ID of the investor right uh sorry it depends
Fred Demargne: relationship.
Ghiles Moussaoui: on the type of the investor if it is individual and it's one one One user can have one um one investor because it's the type is individual. If it is entity,
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it means they have multiple members which means one entity one you know entity investor can have multiple users.
 
 
01:59:06
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So multiple members.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So this table could be Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. I understand.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I think the problem is uh I think u a different way could have been not with we would not have needed this table uh investor user. We could have gone directly um uh uh like not a user ID because you don't want to mix it with the actual logging in user but you could have the user uh table as you did and then directly a profile table uh and in a profile table you have the in the user ID associated and then you have all the different detail about the uh the actual investor or lawyer and then you create we have one the field is a is a role and the role differentiate an investor from um but yes I mean I understand since you did it sequentially uh I understand but I think we would agree that it's not the the cleanest way to do it uh and maybe will
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: impact the performance moving forward so I think for the LS we should leave it like this but we should probably
 
 
02:00:09
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: refactor it moving forward
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, sure. Yeah, I think I think this this is clean because right I'm working on the plan, right? This mostly is clean for when it comes to you have investors and so customers investor portal and staff portal.
Fred Demargne: Yes,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So admin or co portal but we yeah to this new plan it's
Fred Demargne: exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: different because then you would have user you know this is table is is called uh investor users or like users investors and then we would have users um arrangers user CEO and stuff like that.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I mean.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I completely I'm 100% in line with what you said.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Fred Demargne: I completely agree. It's the cleanest way when you have one type of user like you did so far and then once you expand obviously it doesn't work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: But you didn't know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I think if you I mean if it's clear for you.
 
 
02:01:12
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: Um so the entity I think there's a couple there's just maybe one thing to update. Um what else? Um how did you link the notifications to the user ID or to the investor ID? So because each notification is associated to one
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh yeah so notifications
Fred Demargne: user
Ghiles Moussaoui: investors uh user ID it's connected to an investor ID and the user ID both and then
Fred Demargne: because you know uh when we have when you add the other type of users so for one action for one trigger you will have
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. CEO.
Fred Demargne: multiple notification and notification will not be the same.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes,
Fred Demargne: So because it will trigger a different
Ghiles Moussaoui: this can be changed. Yeah, this will be changed. I think um right now that I'm thinking about it I think even the user
Fred Demargne: message.
Ghiles Moussaoui: investors investors notifications will change into terminology wise I will remove investors and take it into consideration as users and then this will be u maybe users is a little bit uh confusing because users is also the person that uses yeah so
 
 
02:02:37
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah let's say accounts it will change into accounts notifications and then there is basically split I
Fred Demargne: If you want the way if you want the way you can call it is you can call user ID for the actual
Ghiles Moussaoui: guess
Fred Demargne: user logging in. I mean the thing which will be the same for any platform and instead of calling it investor
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah
Fred Demargne: user you can call it uh v_ user like verso user I don't know no if you call
Ghiles Moussaoui: member uh no member is already used so
Fred Demargne: verso or yeah something referring to verso that we know it's specific to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: with a ve or v whatever you want to call it then it's we know it's not the the logging
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: It's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I got it. Okay.
Fred Demargne: okay. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: okay. I think I think uh we've done quite a lot today.
 
 
02:03:34
 
Fred Demargne: So, we reviewed the portal. I think we are from what we discussed yesterday, I think it's clear for you. I answered your email about the the look and feel.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think it's it's better to take the investor portal as a reference. Uh white and blue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. What I'm doing is better.
Fred Demargne: Uh I mean, I think it's easier.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: It's better for the moment. Then we can see moving forward, but I think it's clean. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: you shouldn't we shouldn't you should uh you should keep this. I mean, maybe if it's easy,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: we can give the option for the user to move to dark background like you would have earlier.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, makes
Fred Demargne: But um so that's one thing that you can do already.
Ghiles Moussaoui: sense.
Fred Demargne: I think I think we discussed yesterday about how to merge the categories on the right on the left hand
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: side.
 
 
02:04:21
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. We talked about merging the users uh investors, arrangers, introducers into one and adding, you know, arrangers, partners, commercial partners and stuff.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. And the subscription and the stuff that nothing to do with the um with the investor
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: portal uh to leave it in the uh in the uh yeah the port
Ghiles Moussaoui: C.
Fred Demargne: the admin portal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry. Which which ones?
Fred Demargne: I think it was the processes. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: This I know. I thought you're talking about subscriptions or fees and
Fred Demargne: no,
Ghiles Moussaoui: etc.
Fred Demargne: I think subscription should be underneath the investment opportunity. Uh what you call the deals. I think we discussed it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh sorry, how come subscriptions?
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is the investment process like when you know money arrives um to track it is
Fred Demargne: I think
Ghiles Moussaoui: committed to you know pending and then committed and then partially funded then fully funded and it is active and it tracks also the fees and the uh the fees the amount
 
 
02:05:25
 
Fred Demargne: So this should be this should be under the investment opportunity. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I think this is too complex to add it under investment opportunity.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is more uh investment opportunity. This this connects to the investment opportunity. It's just the view but it's not the investment opportunity DUI wise. I think it makes sense because you will have multiple records. It's like a table view as you can see and you can have
Fred Demargne: So it's more report. It's more re reporting
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
Fred Demargne: for maybe we call toilet to report
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you remember yesterday it told me this is the like the dashboard.
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So reports uh it has a summary view here.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We did not go through uh fees and reconciliations.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. because we said that we need to have a dedicated session about this
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: Maybe we can have a call tomorrow to discuss
 
 
02:06:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah that works. I will roll the plan to you if you could give me some feedback on it so I can start
Fred Demargne: this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: work on it. I will create an environment. Um I will see if I can create um a staging structure project for the database. So I don't change everything directly but they change on project and once we have that set we move forward with it and the branch also for the project and we deploy it in versal then we can follow with that does that work?
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: that'll work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. All right. Uh cover some ground.
Fred Demargne: All right. So, let's do that. It's And then you can you can still in your plan um make a reference to what we discussed
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: about entities. I understand you cannot implement it at the same time. You need to first implement the merge, but at least that we keep on track of what we discussed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: of course.
Fred Demargne: I think that would be good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
