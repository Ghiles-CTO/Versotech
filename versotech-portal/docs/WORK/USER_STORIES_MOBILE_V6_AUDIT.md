# Phase 2 User Stories Audit (Mobile V6)

## Scope and Sources
- User stories: `User_stories_Verso_Capital_mobile_V6 (1).xlsx` and `docs/planning/user_stories_mobile_v6_extracted.md`.
- Plan: `versotech-portal/docs/WORK/PHASE2_BASE_PLAN.md`.
- Meeting notes: `docs/planning/meeting1.md`.
- DB schema: `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_DUMP_NEW.sql`, `versotech-portal/src/types/supabase.ts`, and Supabase MCP verification queries.
- Code review: targeted read-throughs of relevant `versotech-portal/src/app` and `versotech-portal/src/components` modules plus keyword search across the codebase.

Note: I did not literally read every line of the repository; this is a deep, feature-oriented code and schema audit aligned to the user stories.

## Status Legend
- Implemented: Feature exists and aligns with the story intent.
- Partial: Some pieces exist, but key parts are missing or the flow is incomplete.
- Missing: No matching UI/API found.
- Deferred: Marked MVP N in requirements and not implemented.
- Unknown: Source story is broken or needs manual review.

## Coverage Summary
- Total stories: 856
- Implemented: 81
- Partial: 428
- Missing: 228
- Deferred: 53
- Unknown: 66
Counts are approximate and will shift slightly as fixes land; see the sections below for verified updates.

## DB Verification (Supabase MCP)
- Verified `deal_data_room_access` columns: `id`, `deal_id`, `investor_id`, `granted_by`, `granted_at`, `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, `revoked_by`, `auto_granted`, `notes`, `last_warning_sent_at`. No `access_type` column exists.
- Verified `deal_memberships` uses `dispatched_at` and `viewed_at` (no `received_at` or `first_viewed_at`).
- Verified `signature_requests` includes `signing_token`, `token_expires_at`, and `signature_timestamp`.
- Verified `investor_members` includes `signature_specimen_url` and `signature_specimen_uploaded_at`.
- Verified `request_tickets` exists with `assigned_to` (so counts can be scoped per-user).
- Verified `subscriptions` includes `commitment`, `funded_amount`, `pack_generated_at`, `pack_sent_at`, `signed_at`, `funded_at`, `activated_at`, plus proxy fields.

## Alignment Addendum (Meeting1 + Phase 2 Plan)
- Main portal for all personas with admin as a separate (minimal) portal: matches plan and meeting intent.
- Growth marketing / CRM: intentionally deferred (no implementation found, consistent with meeting).
- Landing page still routes to legacy portals (`/versoholdings/login`, `/versotech/login`), while the plan calls for a unified portal. Middleware handles redirects, but UX is inconsistent (`versotech-portal/src/app/page.tsx`, `versotech-portal/src/middleware.ts`).
- Ask everyone to re-submit KYC for launch is not enforced end-to-end (no global reset or expiry-driven reminders).
- Partner visibility into investor progress: not implemented as described in the meeting. Partners can access opportunity pages, but the journey bar is built from the viewer's investor ID and shows only the current viewer's journey. There is no partner-facing client journey list or race-style progress view in `versotech-portal/src/app/(main)/versotech_main/opportunities/[id]/page.tsx` and `versotech-portal/src/app/api/investors/me/opportunities/[id]/route.ts`.
- Introducer agreement gating through approvals: not implemented. Approvals are staff-only and not linked to introducer agreements; introducer agreements are read-only lists (`versotech-portal/src/app/(main)/versotech_main/approvals/page.tsx`, `versotech-portal/src/app/(main)/versotech_main/introducer-agreements/page.tsx`).
- Data room access after all NDA signatories: enforced for investor auto-grant, but staff can still grant access manually without signatory checks (`versotech-portal/src/app/api/investors/me/opportunities/[id]/data-room-access/route.ts`, `versotech-portal/src/app/api/deals/[id]/data-room-access/route.ts`).
- Processes moved to Admin Portal: partial. `/versotech_admin/processes` exists, but `/versotech_main/processes` still exposes the same UI.

## Key Bugs / Incorrect Implementations
- Critical security: hardcoded Supabase service-role keys are committed in repo (`versotech-portal/run-migration.mjs`, `versotech-portal/verify-function.mjs`, `versotech-portal/debug-fee-sync.js`, `versotech-portal/scripts/run-migrations.mjs`, `versotech-portal/scripts/apply-migrations-using-service.mjs`, `versotech-portal/VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`). Keys should be revoked/rotated and removed from git history.
- Opportunity detail action gating: `can_express_interest`, `can_sign_nda`, and `can_subscribe` are computed without checking whether the viewer has an investor entity. Non-investor personas can see actions that will fail with 'No investor profile found' (`versotech-portal/src/app/api/investors/me/opportunities/[id]/route.ts`, `versotech-portal/src/app/(main)/versotech_main/opportunities/[id]/page.tsx`).
- NDA completion does not update `deal_memberships` timestamps. Journey stages rely on `deal_memberships`, so NDA/data-room stages can remain stale after automated signing unless a separate update runs (`versotech-portal/src/app/api/automation/nda-complete/route.ts`, `versotech-portal/src/app/api/investors/me/opportunities/[id]/route.ts`).
- Inbox counts: `versotech-portal/src/app/(main)/versotech_main/inbox/page.tsx` counts read conversations (`.not('last_read_at', 'is', null)`), and approvals/requests counts are global, not scoped to the current user.

## Missing / Wrong vs Phase 2 Plan (Action List)
- Enforce NDA signatory gating for data room access (Phase 3 plan): grant access only after all authorized investor signatories have signed; no CEO signature requirement in current plan. Staff manual grants currently bypass this.
- Partner-facing investor progress view (Meeting1): add a partner view that shows client investor journey per deal (journey bar list or equivalent). Current journey bar is viewer-only.
- Introducer agreement approval gating (Meeting1): tie introducer agreement lifecycle to approvals and gate activation on staff approval; current agreements are read-only.
- Ask all investors to re-submit KYC for launch: no global reset or force-resubmission workflow is implemented.
- Processes page should be Admin-only: remove or hard-redirect `/versotech_main/processes`.
- Certificates issuance: issuance/approval/dispatch UI is still missing (plan + user stories); only partial APIs exist.
- Reporting, fee/invoice approvals, funding lifecycle notifications: still incomplete (many stories marked Partial/Missing).
- Optional decision: if you want KYC to be required before invest, add a hard gate in the subscribe API and/or opportunity UI. Current flow does not enforce it.
- Landing page should use unified login routes for Phase 2 (today it points to legacy portals and relies on middleware redirects).
