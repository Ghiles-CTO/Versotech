## API Endpoints Used

### Existing
- `GET /api/staff/requests` - List requests with filters
- `PATCH /api/requests/[id]` - Update request (now includes priority)
- `POST /api/staff/requests/[id]/assign` - Assign request to staff
- `GET /api/profiles` - Fetch staff members
- `POST /api/conversations` - Create conversation

### New
- `GET /api/staff/requests/stats?days={number}` - Fetch analytics data

---

## Database Schema Notes

**No database migrations required!**

All changes use existing schema:
- `request_tickets.priority` - already supports string values
- `request_tickets.status` - already defined
- `request_tickets.assigned_to` - already defined
- No new columns added

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Overdue Calculation:** Currently uses client-side calculation. Could be improved with database function for accuracy.
2. **SLA Tracking:** SLA paused time not fully implemented (requires `sla_paused_at` and `sla_resumed_at` columns).
3. **Conversation Linking:** Creates new conversation each time; doesn't check for existing conversations.
4. **Analytics Charts:** Uses simple progress bars instead of full chart library (Recharts not installed).

---

## Future Enhancements

### Suggested Improvements
1. **Bulk Actions:** Select multiple requests for bulk status/priority/assignment changes
2. **Saved Filters:** Save common filter combinations as presets
3. **Email Notifications:** Notify staff when assigned or when requests go overdue
4. **Advanced Analytics:** Add filters to analytics (by staff, by investor, by category)
5. **Export Reports:** Export analytics data as CSV/Excel
6. **SLA Automation:** Auto-escalate overdue requests
7. **Request Templates:** Pre-fill common request types
8. **Activity Timeline:** Show full audit trail for each request
