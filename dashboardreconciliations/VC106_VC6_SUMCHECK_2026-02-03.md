Notable row handling
- CSV row 20 has no Index but is a valid VC6 row (OEP Ltd). It must be included to match totals.
- Index 73 has Partner label blank but has Partner spread; forward‑fill assigns it to VERSO PARTNER.

Lee Rand Group → individual investors
- Dashboard totals (LEE RAND GROUP rows):
  - commitment 234,935; spread 61,825; shares/ownership 12,365; sub fees 0
- DB totals for those individuals (Atima HARALALKA, Ekta DATT, Nidhi GANERIWALA, Rajesh SUD, Rajiv KAPOOR, Rasika KULKARNI):
  - commitment 234,935; spread 61,825; shares/units 12,365; sub fees 0

Notes
- VC6 total row for BD fees shows 75,884.07, but sum of BD fees in VC6 rows is 70,603.09 (and matches DB). This appears to be a dashboard total‑row inconsistency or hidden rows, not a DB mismatch.
