# VC106 / VC6 Recheck (dashboard vs DB vs VC106 extracts)

Source files:
- `dashboardreconciliations/VERSO DASHBOARD_V1.0.xlsx` (sheet VC6)
- `dashboardreconciliations/VERSO DASHBOARD_V1.0.xlsx - VC6.csv`
- `dashboardreconciliations/06_Full_Subscription_Data_VC106.xlsx`
- `dashboardreconciliations/05_Introducer_Commissions_VC106.xlsx`

## Dashboard totals (full sheet)
Totals row at VC6 row 224 (all rows, including zero-ownership):
- Amount invested (col 12): **74,155,202.84**
- Shares (col 14): **3,248,762**
- Ownership position (col 15): **1,969,517**
- Spread PPS fees (col 18): **17,468,501.60**
- Subscription fees (col 20): **621,394.3712**
- BD fees (col 32): **75,884.0672**

Verification:
- Sum of data rows (4–223) matches totals for Amount, Shares, Ownership, Spread, Subscription fees.
- **BD fees mismatch**: sum of col 32 is **70,603.0872**, not 75,884.0672 (delta **5,280.98**). This is a dashboard total-row issue, not a DB issue.

## Dashboard active-only (ownership > 0) totals
Using rows with ownership > 0 (per rules):
- Commitment: **45,273,028.32**
- Shares: **2,000,775**
- Ownership: **1,969,517**
- Spread fee: **10,051,471.42**
- Subscription fee: **593,099.81**
- BD fee: **70,603.09**
- FINRA fee: **57,636.98**

## DB totals (VC106 subscriptions)
Vehicle id: `ba584abd-ea2b-4a3f-893a-c7e0999f4039`
- Commitment: **45,363,968.32**
- Shares: **2,005,322**
- Spread fee: **10,051,471.42**
- Subscription fee: **593,099.81**
- BD fee: **70,603.09**
- FINRA fee: **57,636.98**

### DB vs dashboard active-only
- All fee totals match exactly.
- **Mismatch**: DB has **one extra subscription** not in dashboard active rows:
  - Investor: **VERSO GROUP**
  - Commitment: **90,940.00**
  - Shares: **4,547**
  - Contract date: **2021-05-17**
  - Dashboard row (VC6 row 93) shows **ownership = 0** → per rules this should **not** be in DB.

## VC106 subscription extract (06 file)
`06_Full_Subscription_Data_VC106.xlsx` totals:
- Commitment **45,363,968.32**
- Shares **2,005,322**
- Subscription fee **593,099.81**
- Spread fee **10,051,471.42**
- BD fee **70,603.09**
- FINRA fee **57,636.98**

Matches DB exactly.
Note: **Current Position** column is per-investor position repeated across subscriptions, so its sum is not meaningful.

## VC106 commissions (05 file)
DB sums by introducer/basis match the VC106 commission file:
- VERSO PARTNER
  - Spread **2,068,621.84**
  - Subscription fees **98,546.81**
- VERSO BI
  - Spread **3,175,841.19**
  - Subscription fees **409,788.94**
- Simone: Spread **8,196.78**
- Setcap: Spread **1,013,655.50**
- Manna Capital: Spread **40,000.00**
- Terra Financial: Spread **19,981.50**

Dashboard cross-check:
- Partner spread total in VC6 (col 53, VERSO PARTNER) **2,068,621.78** (0.06 rounding vs DB).
- Partner subscription fees (col 47) **98,546.8112** → matches DB.
- BI spread (col 63) **3,175,841.192** and BI subscription fees (col 57) **409,788.9488** → match DB.
- Simone spread **8,196.78** → match DB.

## Lee Rand Group (split to individuals)
Dashboard totals for those 6 individuals (from rows with entity “LEE RAND GROUP”):
- Commitment **234,935.00**
- Spread **61,825.00**
DB totals for those same names match exactly.

## Key issues to fix (if any)
1) **VERSO GROUP subscription** (90,940 / 4,547 shares) exists in DB but is ownership=0 in dashboard → remove subscription per rules.
2) **Dashboard BD fees total row** is inconsistent by **5,280.98** vs the column sum. Needs dashboard correction (not DB).
