### Available Personas

| Persona | Description |

| **Investor** | View opportunities, subscribe to deals, manage portfolio |
| **Arranger** | Create vehicles/deals, manage data rooms, process subscriptions |
| **Introducer** | Make client introductions, track commissions |
| **Partner** | Co-arrange deals, receive partnership commissions |
| **Commercial Partner** | Distribute deals to investor network |
| **Lawyer** | Sign certificates, review legal documents |
| **CEO/Staff** | Approve workflows, manage users, oversee operations |

### Multiple Personas

Many users have **multiple personas**. For example:
- An arranger might also be an investor in their own deals

## Switching Personas

If you have multiple personas, you can switch between them:

1. Look for the **persona switcher** in the top navigation bar
2. Click on your current persona name
3. Select the persona you want to switch to from the dropdown

## Understanding Status Flows

Throughout the platform, you'll see status badges indicating where items are in their workflow:

### Subscription Status

The subscription workflow involves **three interconnected status systems**:

**Subscription Status** (financial lifecycle):
`pending` → `committed` → `partially_funded` → `funded` → `active` → `closed` or `cancelled`

**Submission Status** (staff review):
`pending_review` → `approved` or `rejected` or `cancelled`

**Pack Status** (document signing):
`no_pack` → `draft` → `final` → `pending_signature` → `signed`

### Deal Status
`draft` → `open` → `allocation_pending` → `fully_subscribed` → `closed`

### Interest Status
`pending_review` → `approved` or `rejected` or `withdrawn`

### KYC Status
`pending` → `submitted` → `approved` or `rejected` or `expired`

### Commission Status
`accrued` → `invoice_requested` → `invoice_submitted` → `invoiced` → `paid`

> **Note**: Commissions may also be `cancelled` or `rejected` if issues arise.

### Fee Plan Status
`draft` → `sent` → `pending_signature` → `accepted` or `rejected` or `archived`
