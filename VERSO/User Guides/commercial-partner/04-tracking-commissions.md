## Overview

Track your commissions from client subscriptions—from deal close through payment.

## Commission Lifecycle

```
Client Funds → Deal Closes → Commission Accrues → Invoice → Payment
```

### Status Flow

|--------|---------|
| `accrued` | Earned, awaiting invoice |
| `invoice_requested` | Submit invoice |
| `invoice_submitted` | Under review |
| `invoiced` | Approved |
| `paid` | Complete |
| `cancelled` | Commission was cancelled |
| `rejected` | Invoice/commission rejected |

> **Note**: Commissions may be cancelled if client subscriptions are cancelled. Rejections require invoice correction and resubmission.

## Commission Calculation

### Based on Funded Amount

Your commission is on what clients actually fund:

```
Client funded: $500,000
Your rate: 2%
Commission: $10,000
```

### Multiple Clients

Commissions accumulate:
```
Client A: $500K × 2% = $10,000
Client B: $750K × 2% = $15,000
Client C: $300K × 2% = $6,000
Total for deal: $31,000
```
