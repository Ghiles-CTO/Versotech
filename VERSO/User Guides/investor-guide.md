## Troubleshooting

### "I expressed interest but nothing happened"

- CEO approval may be pending
- Check with your contact
- KYC may need to be completed first

### "I signed but my co-signer hasn't"

For entity investments:
- Check if all signatories received email
- Contact your co-signatories directly
- You can request resend from Tasks

### "My KYC was rejected"

- Check rejection reason in notification
- Upload corrected document
- Resubmit for review

### "I wired funds but status still shows Committed"

- Wire matching takes 2-5 business days
- Ensure correct reference was used
- Contact support with wire confirmation if >5 days

### "Deal closed but I don't see my position"

Your subscription must have been `funded` before close:
- If still `committed`, position was not created
- Contact support for resolution

### "Can't access data room"

- NDA must be fully signed (all parties)
- Check if access expired
- Request extension if needed
