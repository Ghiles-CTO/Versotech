## Partner vs Introducer

| Aspect | Partner | Introducer |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Relationship** | Strategic, ongoing | Referral-based |
| **Deal Access** | May get preferential access | Based on introductions |
| **Commission Source** | Partnership agreements | Per-deal fee plans |
| **Investment** | May co-invest | Typically referral only |

---

## 1. Getting Onboarded

### Your Profile

Complete your partner profile:

1. **Profile** → **Edit Profile**
2. Required:
   - Legal name / Company name
   - Email
   - Phone
   - Address
   - Bank details
   - Tax information

### KYC Requirements

Same as other users - identity verification required.

---

## 2. Partnership Agreement

Before participating in deals or earning commissions, you need a signed agreement.

### How It Works

1. Arranger/CEO creates Partnership Agreement
2. They sign first (Party A)
3. You receive signing notification
4. Review and sign (Party B)
5. Agreement becomes **ACTIVE**

### For Entity Partners

If you're a company:
- All authorized signatories must sign
- Each receives signing link
- Complete when all have signed

### Agreement Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending Signature** | Your signature needed |
| **Active** | In effect |
| **Expired** | Past end date |

> **Requirement:** Active agreement needed for commissions.

## 3. Fee Plans & Commissions

### Understanding Fee Plans

Like introducers, your commission terms are set per deal.

> **Fee plans are DEAL-SPECIFIC.**

### Fee Plan Details

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Deal** | Which opportunity |
| **Rate (bps)** | Your commission rate |
| **Fee Type** | subscription, management, performance |
| **Status** | sent, accepted, rejected |

### Accepting Fee Plans

**Fee Plans** → find pending fee plans → **Accept**

> **Accept BEFORE deal closes** or no commission is created.

---

## 4. Commission Lifecycle

### When Created

Commissions are created at deal close when:
1. Partnership agreement is **ACTIVE**
2. Fee plan is **ACCEPTED**
3. Investor dispatched with your fee plan
4. Subscription is **FUNDED**

### Calculation

```
Commission = funded_amount × (rate_bps / 10,000)
```

### Status Flow

```
ACCRUED → INVOICE_REQUESTED → INVOICE_SUBMITTED → INVOICED → PAID
```

---

## 5. Submitting Invoices

### When Commissions Accrue

1. Find accrued commissions in **My Commissions**
2. Click **Submit Invoice**
3. Upload your invoice document
4. Submit for processing

### Invoice Requirements

- Your invoice number
- Correct amount (matching commission)
- Bank details
- Tax information
- Service description

### After Submission

- Arranger reviews
- If approved → payment queue
- If rejected → resubmit with corrections

---

## 6. Tracking Your Activity

### Fee Plans

**Fee Plans** shows:
- All plans offered to you
- Acceptance status
- Commission rates

### Commissions

**My Commissions** shows:
- All earned commissions
- Status tracking
- Payment history

### Summary Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Total Accrued | Pending invoicing |
| Total Invoiced | Awaiting payment |
| Total Paid | Received |

---

## 7. Co-Investment (If Applicable)

Some partners may also invest in deals.

### Investing as Partner

1. Express interest in deal
2. Complete standard subscription process
3. Your investment tracked separately from commissions

### Dual Role

You can earn commission AND invest:
- Commission on OTHER investors you refer
- Investment returns on YOUR subscription

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No commission for a deal I participated in"

Check:
1. Partnership agreement **ACTIVE**?
2. Fee plan **ACCEPTED**?
3. Investor dispatched with your fee plan?
4. Subscription **FUNDED**?
5. Deal **CLOSED**?

### "Invoice rejected"

Review reason, correct issues, resubmit.

### "Can't see deals"

- You may need to be dispatched to specific deals
- Contact arranger for access
