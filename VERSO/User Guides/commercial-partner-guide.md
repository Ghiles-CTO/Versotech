### Fee Plan Structure

Like other referral relationships, fee plans are **deal-specific**.

### Accepting Fee Plans

**Fee Plans** → find pending → **Accept**

### Commission Calculation

At deal close:

Commission = investor's funded_amount × (rate_bps / 10,000)
```

For all investors you brought to the deal.
