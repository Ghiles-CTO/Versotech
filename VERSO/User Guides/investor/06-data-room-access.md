# Investor Guide: Data Room Access

Access and review confidential deal documents in the secure data room.

---

## Overview

The data room contains confidential materials about the investment opportunity. Access is granted after you sign the NDA and is time-limited for security.

---

## Getting Access

### Prerequisites
1. ✅ Interest approved
2. ✅ NDA fully signed (all signatories)
3. ✅ Countersignature complete (if required)

### Access Notification

When access is granted:
1. **Email** confirming data room access
2. **Platform notification** in your bell icon
3. **Deal detail page** shows "Data Room" tab unlocked

---

## The 7-Day Auto-Grant Window

### Automatic Access Period

When your NDA is fully signed, data room access is **automatically granted** for **7 calendar days**.

```
Day 1: NDA completed → Access auto-granted
Day 7: Access expires at 11:59 PM (auto-revoked)
```

### Auto-Grant vs Manual Grant

| Type | Trigger | Duration |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Auto-Grant** | NDA fully signed | 7 days (automatic) |
| **Manual Grant** | Staff extends access | Custom duration |
| **Extension** | Staff approves request | Additional days |

> **Note**: Staff can manually grant access or extend the auto-grant period at any time. The 7-day window is the default automatic behavior.

### Why Time-Limited?

- Protects confidential information
- Encourages timely decision-making
- Maintains security best practices
- Aligns with deal timelines
