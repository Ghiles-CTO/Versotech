# Investor Guide: Signing the NDA

After your interest is approved, you must sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement before accessing confidential deal materials.

---

## Overview

The NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) protects confidential information shared in the data room. It's a legally binding agreement between you/your entity and the deal arranger.

---

## The NDA Flow

```
Interest Approved → NDA Generated → Sent for Signature → All Sign → Data Room Access
```

---

## Receiving the NDA

### How You're Notified

When your interest is approved:
1. **Email notification** sent to all signatories
2. **Platform notification** appears in your bell icon
3. **Tasks list** shows "NDA Awaiting Signature"

### What's Included

The NDA typically covers:
- Confidentiality of data room materials
- Permitted use of information
- Return/destruction of documents
- Term of confidentiality
- Governing law

## Multi-Signatory NDAs

If you're investing through an entity with multiple signatories:

### How It Works

1. **NDA sent to ALL signatories** simultaneously
2. Each signatory **signs independently**
3. NDA is only complete when **EVERYONE has signed**
4. Data room access is granted **after full completion**

### Example: Entity with 2 Directors

```
Director A signs: 50% complete
Director B signs: 100% complete → Data Room Access ✓
```

> **Critical**: One missing signature blocks the entire process. Ensure all signatories are available.

## Tracking Signature Status

### For Individual Investors

Your dashboard shows:
- `Pending` - Awaiting your signature
- `Signed` - You've completed signing
- `Completed` - Fully executed (countersigned if needed)

### For Entity Investments

Track who has signed:
1. Go to deal **Interest** details
2. Click **"View Signature Status"**
3. See each signatory's status:
   - ✓ Signed
   - ⏳ Pending
   - ✗ Not yet sent

## What Happens After Signing

### When All Signatures Complete

1. **Fully Signed NDA** is generated
2. **Copies sent** to all signatories
3. **Data Room access** is automatically granted
4. **7-day access window** begins

### Counterparty Signature

Some NDAs require arranger countersignature:
1. Your signature completes first
2. Arranger receives and signs
3. Final executed copy distributed

## Signature Timeline

Act promptly on NDA requests:

| Delay | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| > 24 hours | May slow down access |
| > 3 days | Risk missing data room window |
| > 7 days | Interest may be archived |

## Coordinating Multiple Signatories

If you're managing entity signatories:

### Best Practices

1. **Alert all signatories** that NDA is coming
2. **Set a deadline** (e.g., "Please sign within 48 hours")
3. **Track status** through the platform
4. **Send reminders** for pending signatures

### Reminder Function

To remind a signatory:
1. Go to signature status view
2. Click **"Send Reminder"** next to pending signatory
3. They'll receive another email notification

## Common Issues

### "I didn't receive the NDA email"

1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify the email on your profile is correct
3. Request resend through the platform
4. Contact support if issues persist

### "The signature link expired"

Links typically valid for 7 days. If expired:
1. Request a new link from the platform
2. Or access via **Tasks** on the platform

### "One of our signatories is unavailable"

Options:
1. Wait for their return
2. Update entity signatories (requires documentation)
3. Contact the arranger to discuss alternatives

### "I signed but data room isn't accessible"

Check if:
1. All other signatories have signed
2. Arranger countersignature is pending
3. Access may take a few minutes to provision
