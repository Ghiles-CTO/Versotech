## Overview

After signing the subscription documents, you need to wire the funds to the designated account. This guide covers the funding process from receiving wire instructions to confirmation.

## Funding Flow

```
Documents Signed → Wire Instructions Received → Funds Sent → Funds Received → Confirmed
```

## Receiving Wire Instructions

### When You Receive Them

Wire instructions are sent after:

3. Account details are confirmed

### How You Receive Them

1. **Email** with wire instruction PDF

## Funding Status Tracking

### Status Updates

Your subscription status reflects funding:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `committed` | Awaiting your funds |
| `partially_funded` | Some funds received (partial payment) |
| `funded` | Full amount received |

### Where to Check

1. **My Subscriptions** → Click your subscription
2. **Funding** tab shows:
   - Amount expected
   - Amount received
   - Date received
   - Outstanding (if any)

---

## Partial Funding

### When It Applies

Some deals allow partial funding:
- Send portion now, remainder later
- Must meet minimum thresholds
- Additional fees may apply

### How It Works

1. Wire the first portion
2. Report it on the platform
3. Status shows `partially_funded`
4. Wire remainder by deadline
5. Status updates to `funded`

## Common Funding Issues

### Wire Rejected by Bank

Common reasons:
- Incorrect SWIFT code
- Account name mismatch
- Missing reference
- Compliance block

Solution:
1. Contact your bank for specific reason
2. Correct the issue
3. Resend the wire

### Funds Not Showing Up

If 5+ business days have passed:
1. Check with your bank that wire was sent
2. Get the SWIFT confirmation/tracking
3. Contact the arranger with this information
4. They can trace through receiving bank

### Amount Discrepancy

If you sent a different amount:
- **Sent more**: Excess will be noted, discuss with arranger
- **Sent less**: May be treated as partial funding
- **Currency conversion loss**: May need to send difference

### Missing Reference

If you forgot the reference:
1. Contact the arranger immediately
2. Provide your bank reference
3. They can manually match the funds

## Funding Deadline

### Why Deadlines Matter

Deals typically have funding deadlines:
- Late funding risks your allocation
- Deal may close without you
- Extensions require approval

### Checking Your Deadline

2. Check **Subscription Details** → **Key Dates**
3. Ask the arranger if unclear

### Requesting Extension

If you can't meet the deadline:
1. Contact the arranger immediately
2. Explain the situation
3. Request a specific extension date
4. Get confirmation in writing
