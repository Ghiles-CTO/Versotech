# Investor Guide: Deal Close & Position Activation

Understand what happens when a deal closes and your investment becomes active.

---

## Overview

When a deal closes, your subscription transitions to an active position in your portfolio. This guide explains the closing process and what to expect.

---

## Deal Close Flow

```
All Funds Received → Arranger Requests Close → CEO Approves → Deal Closes → Positions Created
```

---

## What Triggers Deal Close

A deal is ready to close when:
- ✅ Target raise achieved (or acceptable level)
- ✅ All subscriptions fully funded
- ✅ Legal documentation complete
- ✅ Regulatory requirements met

### Close Request

The arranger submits a close request to CEO/staff who verifies:
- All subscriptions are properly documented
- All funds are received
- All compliance checks passed

---

## What Happens at Close

### 1. Subscription Status Changes

Your subscription moves from `funded` to `active`:
```
funded → active
```

### 2. Position Created

A **position** is created representing your holding:

| Position Field | Value |
|----------------|-------|
| Units | Number of shares/units you own |
| Cost Basis | Your investment amount |
| Acquisition Date | Deal close date |
| Current NAV | Initial = Cost Basis |

### 3. Documents Generated

You receive:
- **Share Certificate** or equivalent
- **Confirmation of Position**
- Updated **Portfolio Statement**

### 4. Commission Processing

For referral relationships:
- Introducer/partner commissions are finalized
- Status moves to `accrued`
- Invoice process begins
