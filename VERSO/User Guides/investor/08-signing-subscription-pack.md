# Investor Guide: Signing the Subscription Pack

Complete your investment commitment by signing the subscription documents.

---

## Overview

The subscription pack contains all legal documents formalizing your investment. For entity investments, **all signatories must sign** before the documents are considered executed.

---

## What's in the Subscription Pack

Typical documents include:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Subscription Agreement** | Your commitment to invest |
| **Limited Partnership Agreement** (or equivalent) | Fund terms and investor rights |
| **Side Letter** (if applicable) | Any special terms |
| **Tax Forms** | W-8BEN, W-9, or equivalent |
| **Investor Questionnaire** | Additional declarations |

---

## The Signing Flow

### For Individual Investors
```
Pack Generated → You Sign → Countersigned → Executed
```

### For Entity Investors
```
Pack Generated → Signatory 1 Signs → Signatory 2 Signs → ... → All Signed → Countersigned → Executed
```

> **Critical**: Entity subscriptions require **ALL** authorized signatories to sign. Missing signatures block the entire process.
