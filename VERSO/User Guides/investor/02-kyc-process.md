# Investor Guide: KYC Process

Know Your Customer (KYC) verification is required before you can invest. This guide explains what documents you need and how to complete the process.

---

## Overview

KYC verification ensures regulatory compliance and protects all parties. You must complete KYC for:
- **Yourself** (personal investments)
- **Each entity** you invest through

---

## KYC Status Flow

Your KYC moves through these stages:

```
pending → submitted → approved ✓
                    → rejected ✗ (resubmit required)
                    → expired ⚠️ (renewal required)
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Awaiting your submission |
| `submitted` | Awaiting review by VERSO staff |
| `approved` | You can now invest |
| `rejected` | Documents need correction and resubmission |
| `expired` | KYC approval has lapsed and requires renewal |

> **Note**: Once KYC is approved, you have **24 months** before it expires and requires renewal. You'll receive reminders as expiry approaches.

You'll receive reminders when renewal is needed.

## Common Questions

### "How long does review take?"

Typically 1-3 business days for standard applications. Complex structures may take longer.

### "Can I invest while KYC is pending?"

No. You must have `approved` status to subscribe to deals.

### "Do I need separate KYC for each deal?"

No. Once approved, your KYC is valid across all deals. However, each entity needs its own KYC.
