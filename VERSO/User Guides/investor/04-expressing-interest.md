## Overview

Expressing interest is the first step in your investment journey. It signals to the arranger that you want to learn more about a deal and potentially invest.

## The Interest Flow

```
Express Interest → Pending Review → Approved → NDA Sent
                                  → Rejected (with reason)
                                  → Withdrawn (by you)
```

## Choosing the Investing Entity

When expressing interest, select carefully:

### Personal Investment
Choose **"Personal"** if:
- You're investing in your own name
- KYC is completed personally

### Entity Investment
Choose a specific entity if:
- Investing through a company/trust
- That entity has completed KYC
- All signatories are set up

> **Important**: Once you express interest with an entity, subsequent documents will be for that entity. Choose correctly to avoid needing to restart.

## The Indicative Amount

While not binding, the indicative amount:
- Helps arrangers gauge demand
- May influence allocation decisions
- Shows you've thought about the opportunity

### Guidelines
- Be realistic about your capacity
- Round to sensible numbers
- Can be updated before subscription

## Interest via Introducer

If an introducer connected you to the deal:

1. They may have already indicated interest on your behalf
2. You'll still need to confirm personally
3. Their fee plan determines their commission

The "How You Heard" field should reference your introducer to ensure proper tracking.

## Tracking Your Interest

### View Interest Status

1. Go to **Investment Opportunities** in the left sidebar
2. Your **Pending interests** count shows in the summary cards
3. Filter deals by your pipeline status to see pending, approved, etc.

### Interest Details

Click on any interest to see:
- Submission date
- Current status
- Any notes from the arranger
- Next steps

## Withdrawing Interest

Changed your mind before approval?

1. Go to **My Interests**
2. Find the relevant deal
3. Click **"Withdraw Interest"**
4. Confirm the withdrawal

> **Note**: You can re-express interest later if the deal is still open.

## Multiple Entities, Same Deal

You can express interest from multiple entities for the same deal:
- Each expression is tracked separately
- Each entity can subscribe independently
- NDA and documents are per-entity

## Common Questions

### "How long until I hear back?"

Typically 1-5 business days. Complex cases (new investors, large amounts) may take longer.

### "Can I express interest in multiple deals?"

Yes, you can have active interest in as many deals as you like.

### "What if my interest is rejected?"

You'll receive feedback on why. Common reasons:
- Insufficient KYC
- Geographic restrictions
- Investment amount below minimum
- Deal is oversubscribed

### "I expressed interest but can't see the data room"

Interest approval triggers NDA. You need to:
1. Wait for interest approval
2. Sign the NDA
3. Then access opens
