## Adding Investment Entities

Most sophisticated investors invest through entities (companies, trusts, family offices) rather than personally. Adding entities allows you to:
- Choose which entity subscribes to each deal
- Manage different investment strategies per entity
- Maintain proper legal separation

### Creating a New Entity

1. Navigate to **Profile** → **My Entities** tab
2. Click **"+ Add Entity"**
3. Complete the entity form:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Entity Name | Legal registered name |
| Entity Type | Company, Trust, Family Office, LP, etc. |
| Jurisdiction | Country/state of registration |
| Registration Number | Company/Trust number |
| Registered Address | Official address on file |
| Tax ID | VAT/EIN/equivalent |

### Adding Entity Members

For entity investments, you'll need to specify:
- **Authorized Signatories** - Who can sign on behalf of the entity
- **Beneficial Owners** - Ultimate ownership structure (for KYC)
- **Directors/Trustees** - Governing body members

#### To Add Members:
1. After creating the entity, click **"Manage Members"**
2. Click **"+ Add Member"**
3. Enter member details:
   - Full name
   - Role (Director, Signatory, UBO, etc.)
   - Email (for signature requests)
   - Ownership percentage (if applicable)

> **Important**: Entity investments require signatures from ALL authorized signatories. Make sure you add everyone who needs to sign.

## Multi-Signatory Considerations

If your entity has multiple signatories:
- All signatories will receive signature requests
- Documents won't progress until **every** signatory has signed
- Each signatory needs their own Versotech account

### Example: Company with 2 Directors

Both directors must:
1. Have accounts on Versotech
2. Be listed as signatories on the entity
3. Sign every subscription document

## Profile Verification

Some information triggers verification:

| What | How Verified |
|------|--------------|
| Email | Confirmation link sent |
| Phone | SMS verification code |
| Identity | KYC document submission (see [KYC Process](./02-kyc-process.md)) |

---

## Common Issues

### "I can't see any investment opportunities"

1. Make sure your profile is complete (100% progress)
2. Check if you need to complete KYC first
3. Verify you're logged in with the **Investor** persona

### "My entity isn't showing when I try to subscribe"

1. Ensure the entity has at least one signatory
2. Check that the entity has completed KYC
3. Verify the entity is marked as "Active"
