## Overview

Subscribing is your formal commitment to invest in a deal. The platform uses a **two-step process**:

1. **Commitment Form** - Select units and fee plan
2. **Subscription Form** - Specify amount, entity, and source of funds

## Subscription Flow

Your subscription is tracked across three related statuses:

| **Submission Status** | Staff review | `pending_review` → `approved`/`rejected`/`cancelled` |

- Each of your entities

Each is processed independently.

### "What if I want to change the amount later?"

You'll receive:
- Email notification

### Source of Funds
