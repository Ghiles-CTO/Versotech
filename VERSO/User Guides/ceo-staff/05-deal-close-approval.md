# CEO & Staff Guide: Deal Close Approval

Approve deal closings to finalize investments and create positions.

---

## Overview

When an arranger requests a deal close, CEO/staff approval is required. This is the final approval before subscriptions become active positions.

---

## What Deal Close Does

### The Flow

```
Arranger Requests Close
    → Staff Reviews
        → CEO Approves
            → Close Executed
                → Positions Created
                → Certificates Generated
                → Commissions Accrued
```

### Why It Matters

Deal close approval:
- Finalizes investor commitments
- Creates portfolio positions
