## Key Concepts for Arrangers

### Vehicle vs Deal

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vehicle** | The fund structure (legal entity, service providers) |
| **Deal** | Specific investment opportunity within a vehicle |

One vehicle can have multiple deals.

### Fee Plans are Deal-Specific

> **Important**: Fee plans are created for specific deals, not as templates. Each deal requires its own fee plan configuration for each introducer/partner relationship.

### Subscription Status Flow

```
pending → committed → partially_funded → funded → active
```
