# Arranger Guide: Dispatching Investors

Share deals with your network and connect investors to opportunities.

---

## Overview

**Dispatching** is how you:
- Share deals with introducers/partners
- Connect specific investors to deals
- Ensure proper fee plan attribution
- Track who referred which investor

---

## The Dispatch Concept

When you dispatch:
1. A deal is shared with a network member
2. They can share with their investors
3. Investors who subscribe are linked to that introducer
4. Commissions track automatically

---

## Dispatching a Deal to Your Network

### Step 1: Access Dispatch

From your deal:
1. Go to **Deal Overview**
2. Click **"Dispatch"** or **"Share with Network"**

### Step 2: Select Recipients

Choose who receives the deal:

| Option | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| **All Network** | Broad distribution |
| **Select Members** | Targeted sharing |
| **By Tag** | Segment distribution |

### Step 3: Fee Plan Requirement

> **Important**: Each recipient must have an accepted fee plan for this deal before they can make introductions with commission tracking.

The system shows:
- ✅ Has accepted fee plan
- ⚠️ Fee plan sent, pending
- ❌ No fee plan - create one

### Step 4: Send Dispatch

1. Add optional message
2. Click **"Dispatch"**
3. Recipients receive notification
4. Deal appears in their portal

## What Recipients See

### Introducer View

When dispatched, introducers see:
- Deal summary and highlights
- Materials they can share
- Link to make introductions
- Their fee plan terms

### Partner View

Partners see:
- Full deal details
- Commission structure
- Investor pipeline tools

## Connecting Specific Investors

### Adding an Investor to a Deal

Sometimes you know a specific investor should see a deal:

1. Go to deal detail
2. Click **"Add Investor"**
3. Search for the investor
4. Select the investor
5. Optionally link to an introducer

### Linking to Introducer

When adding an investor manually:
1. Check **"Link to Introducer"**
2. Select the introducer
3. Confirm fee plan applies
4. Introducer gets commission if investor subscribes

---

## Fee Plan Attribution

### Why It Matters

Fee plan links determine:
- Who gets commission
- What rate applies
- When payment is due

### How Attribution Works

```
Investor subscribes
    → Check who introduced them
        → Check introducer's fee plan
            → Calculate commission
```

### Changing Attribution

If attribution is wrong:
1. Contact VERSO operations
2. Provide correct introducer
3. Attribution corrected before close

## Attribution Rules

### First Touch

Standard rule: first introducer who links the investor gets attribution.

### Deal-Specific Override

For specific deals, you can:
1. Override standard attribution
2. Split attribution (multiple introducers)
3. Assign manually

### Documentation

Keep records of:
- How investor was introduced
- Which deals they're linked to
- Any special arrangements

---

## Common Issues

### "Introducer says they can't see the deal"

Check:
1. Was deal dispatched to them?
2. Is the deal status `open`?
3. Do they have an accepted fee plan?

### "Wrong introducer attributed"

1. Verify correct introducer
2. Contact VERSO operations
3. Correction made with audit trail

### "Investor received deal but shouldn't have"

1. Check who dispatched
2. Revoke access if needed
3. Review distribution controls

---

## Best Practices

### Targeted Distribution

- Don't mass-dispatch everything
- Match deals to network specializations
- Quality over quantity

### Fee Plan First

Always ensure:
1. Fee plan created
2. Sent for acceptance
3. Accepted before dispatch

### Clear Communication

Tell network members:
- What they're receiving
- Expected actions
- Timeline and urgency
