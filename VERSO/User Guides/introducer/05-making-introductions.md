Your Introduction

        → Interest approved, NDA sent
            → NDA signed, data room access
                → Due diligence
                    → Subscription submitted
                        → Documents signed
                            → Funds wired
                                → Deal closes
                                    → Your commission ✓
```

## When Commission Accrues

### Trigger: Deal Close

Your commission accrues when:
1. Your investor has funded
2. The deal closes
3. Position is created

### Commission Amount

Based on:
- Actual funded amount
- Your fee plan rate
- Any tier calculations

---

## Best Practices

### Quality Over Quantity

Focus on:
- Suitable investors
- Proper fit
- Realistic expectations

### Proper Documentation

Always:
- Record through the platform
- Include accurate details
- Update as needed

### Stay Engaged

After introducing:
- Check in with investor
- Track progress
- Be available for questions

## Multiple Introductions

### Same Investor, Different Deals

You can introduce the same investor to multiple deals:
- Each is tracked separately
- Each has its own fee plan
- Commissions are independent

### Multiple Investors, Same Deal

Introduce as many as appropriate:
- Each tracked independently
- Combined volume may reach tiers
- Quality maintained

## Handling Existing Relationships

### Investor Already Known to Arranger

If the investor is already in the arranger's network:
- Your introduction may not apply
- Discuss with arranger
- Attribution rules vary

### Investor You've Introduced Before

For repeat investors:
- New introduction for new deal
- Previous relationship documented
- Commission on new investment

## Common Issues

### "Investor says they didn't receive anything"

1. Check email address is correct
2. Ask them to check spam
3. Contact arranger to resend

### "My introduction isn't showing"

1. Verify you submitted successfully
2. Check the deal is correct
3. Contact support if missing

### "Investor subscribed but I don't see commission"

Check:
1. Was fee plan accepted before intro?
2. Did deal close?
3. Is commission in `accrued` status?
