## Understanding Your Role

### What Introducers Do

1. **Receive deals** from arrangers
2. **Review opportunities** for fit
3. **Introduce investors** to deals
4. **Track progress** of referrals
5. **Earn commissions** on funded subscriptions
6. **Submit invoices** to receive payment

### The Introduction Cycle

```
Arranger dispatches deal
    → You review and accept
        → You introduce investor
            → Investor subscribes
                → Investor funds
                    → You earn commission
                        → You invoice
                            → You get paid
```

## Key Concepts

### Fee Plans are Deal-Specific

> **Important**: Each deal has its own fee plan. You must accept the fee plan for a specific deal before your introductions qualify for commission on that deal.

### Commission Basis

Commission is calculated on the **funded amount**—the actual capital the investor commits and funds, not management fees or other charges.

### Introduction Attribution

Your commission is tied to:
- Investors you formally introduce
- Through the platform's introduction system
- With an accepted fee plan in place
