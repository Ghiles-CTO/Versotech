# Introducer Guide: Understanding Fee Plans

Learn how fee plans work and what they mean for your commissions.

---

## Overview

A **Fee Plan** defines your commission structure for a specific deal. Understanding fee plans is essential for knowing what you'll earn from successful introductions.

---

## Key Concept

> **Important**: Fee plans are DEAL-SPECIFIC. Each deal has its own fee plan for you. The same arranger might offer different terms on different deals.

---

## Commission Basis

### Always Based on Funded Amount

Regardless of how the fee plan is structured:
- Commission is calculated on what the investor **actually funds**
- Not on management fees
- Not on performance fees
- The real capital committed

### Example

```
Investor funds: $500,000
Your fee plan: 2%
Your commission: $500,000 × 2% = $10,000
```

---

## Fee Plan Components

### 1. Rate Structure

How your commission percentage is determined:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Flat Rate** | Single percentage on all amounts |
| **Tiered** | Different rates for different amounts |
| **Graduated** | Higher tiers on incremental amounts only |

### 2. Timing

When you get paid:

| Timing | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **At Close** | When deal closes |
| **On Funding** | When investor's funds received |
| **Deferred** | After a specified period |

### 3. Payment Terms

How payment works:

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **One-time** | Single payment |
| **Installments** | Split over time |
| **Trailing** | Ongoing annual payments |

---

## Rate Structures Explained

### Flat Rate

Simple, single percentage:
```
Rate: 2%
Investor funds $1,000,000
Commission: $20,000
```

### Tiered Rates

Different rates for volume levels:
```
Tier 1: $0 - $500K @ 2.5%
Tier 2: $500K - $1M @ 2.0%
Tier 3: $1M+ @ 1.5%

Investor funds: $750,000
Falls in Tier 2: 2.0%
Commission: $750,000 × 2% = $15,000
```

### Graduated Rates

Rates apply to incremental amounts:
```
First $500K @ 2.5%
Next $500K @ 2.0%
Above $1M @ 1.5%

Investor funds: $1,200,000
  $500K × 2.5% = $12,500
  $500K × 2.0% = $10,000
  $200K × 1.5% = $3,000
Total: $25,500
```

---

## Trailing Commissions

### What They Are

Ongoing payments over time:
```
Initial: 1.5% at close
Trail: 0.25% annually for 5 years
```

### How They Work

1. Initial commission at close
2. Annual commission on anniversary
3. Based on remaining investment value
4. Stops if investor exits

### Example Over Time

```
Year 0 (Close): $500K × 1.5% = $7,500
Year 1: $500K × 0.25% = $1,250
Year 2: $520K × 0.25% = $1,300 (NAV increased)
...
```

## Comparing Fee Plans

### When Evaluating

Consider:

- Structure (flat vs tiered)
- Payment timing
- Deal characteristics

### Deal Context Matters

Higher volume deals might justify lower rates if:
- Larger investor base
- Easier conversions
- More prestige

---

## Multiple Fee Plans

### Same Arranger, Different Deals

Each deal has its own fee plan:
- Terms may vary
- Accept/reject independently
- Track separately

### Different Arrangers

You might have:
- Multiple arranger relationships
- Each with their own agreements
- Each with deal-specific fee plans

---

## What Affects Commission Amounts

### Factors That Impact Earnings

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Rate** | Direct multiplier |
| **Investor Size** | Larger = higher absolute |
| **Tier Structure** | May benefit high volume |
| **Conversion Success** | More funded = more earned |

## Important Notes

### No Fee Plan = No Commission

If you introduce someone without an accepted fee plan:
- No automatic tracking
- No guaranteed commission
- Always verify before introducing

### Changes After Acceptance

Once accepted, fee plans typically can't change for existing introductions:
- Your terms locked in
- Apply to subsequent intros
- New terms require new fee plan

---

## Common Questions

### "Why do rates differ between deals?"

Deals have different:
- Risk profiles
- Target sizes
- Competition levels
- Arranger preferences

### "Can I negotiate the rate?"

Yes, you can:
1. Reject the fee plan
2. Explain desired terms
3. Arranger may revise
4. Accept revised plan

### "What if investor funds less than expected?"

Commission based on actual funded amount:
- Investor commits $500K
- But funds only $400K
- Commission on $400K
