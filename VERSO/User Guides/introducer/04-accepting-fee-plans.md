# Introducer Guide: Accepting Fee Plans

Learn how to accept fee plans and why timing matters.

---

## Overview

Accepting a fee plan is your formal agreement to the commission terms for a specific deal. You must accept before making introductions to ensure proper commission tracking.

---

## Why Acceptance Matters

### Commission Tracking

When you accept:
- Platform tracks your introductions
- Commissions calculate automatically
- Attribution is clear

### Without Acceptance

If you introduce before accepting:
- No automatic tracking
- Commission may not be recorded
- Disputes can arise

---

## Receiving Fee Plans

### How You're Notified

When an arranger creates a fee plan for you:
1. **Email notification** with summary
2. **Platform notification** in bell icon
3. **Fee Plans** section shows pending

### Notification Contents

- Deal name and summary
- Commission rate/structure
- Payment timing

4. Wait for revised fee plan

### Common Negotiation Points

---

## Timing Considerations

### Accept Before Introducing

> **Critical**: Accept the fee plan BEFORE making introductions. Late acceptance may not cover earlier referrals.

### Timeline

```
Fee plan sent → You accept → You introduce → Commission tracks ✓
Fee plan sent → You introduce → You accept → Commission may not track ✗
```

### Best Practice

As soon as fee plan arrives:
1. Review promptly
2. Decide quickly
3. Accept or negotiate
4. Then start introducing

---

## Managing Multiple Fee Plans

### Same Deal, Different Terms?

Typically one fee plan per introducer per deal. If you see duplicates, contact the arranger.

### Different Deals

You'll have separate fee plans for each deal:
- Review each independently
- Accept/reject per deal
- Track status across deals

### Fee Plan List View

Go to **Fee Plans** to see:
- All fee plans by status
- Filter by deal or arranger
- Quick actions available

## Fee Plan Statuses Review

| Status | Meaning | Your Action |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `sent` | Awaiting your response | Review and decide |
| `pending_signature` | Requires your signature | Sign to finalize |
| `accepted` | You agreed and signed | Can introduce |
| `rejected` | You declined | Negotiate or ignore |
| `superseded` | Replaced by new version | Review new one |
| `archived` | No longer active | For reference only |

> **Note**: Some fee plans require your signature to finalize acceptance. When you see `pending_signature`, complete the signing process to activate the fee plan.

## What Happens After Acceptance

## Common Questions

### "What if I miss the fee plan notification?"

1. Check **Fee Plans** regularly
