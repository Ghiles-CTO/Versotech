Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem.
Julien Machot: happy new year.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Best wishes for this uh this year.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Thanks.
Julien Machot: Um as you already know, we have a lot of work in common here. Thanks for making it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um just so I I came out.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: I've been sick unfortunately for the past week. So I'm just um um aiming at a couple of things for this call. Primarily is to check with you guys uh the current uh status of the work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I know you had exchange and Fred had made a number of comments that were quite impacting uh structurally impacting uh the work that had already uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: produced. So it's to find out the status of work and then it's to probably to discuss um and I think maybe we'll do it in a separate call to go into details because not feeling yet 100% back unfortunately uh but maybe tomorrow we could go into the list of agents.
 
 
00:01:03
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: I want to be able to uh activate all these different agents and review exactly what workload they're going to accomplish for us every day.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. All
Julien Machot: And last but not least is just a quick chat on the sequence. Um how do we prep for the launch? How are we going to uh start up? Basically the target date is January 10. Um conveniently my birthday symbolically. It's to say okay on that day in the morning we know we're ready and we're launching and something happens. So a series of triggers and actions.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right.
Julien Machot: So Ashish is with me by the way on the call as well. Hello everyone. Happy new year.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: Happy new year.
Julien Machot: So happy to hear from you guys.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Thanks.
Julien Machot: I don't know Fred or who wants to start. Um but maybe give us like the latest
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: updates.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, start. So, first um happy new year to all of you.
 
 
00:02:09
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah.
Julien Machot: Thank you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And so with Fred, we basically drafted the plan before Christmas uh called phase two plan where we will basically the main thing is to consolidate both portals into one called Verso main uh and then allow each persona to have their own kind view of the uh platform having their own features, their own pages and basically the business logic is controlled by the user stories, the PRD that Fred um shared with me. So there's the CEO, arranger, um investor, introducer, the partner, commercial partner, the lawyer uh so far. And so what I've been doing I think I should share my screen.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Do you need authorization for me? No. Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, we drafted the um phase 2 plan and this is basically the status of everything um that has been done, right? So about 80% uh of it is completely finished and so we created all the tables that are necessary for um should I go into details or should I have an
 
 
00:03:49
 
Julien Machot: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: overview?
Julien Machot: at my level I don't need the details really uh for sake of time also because it's January 2nd.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Julien Machot: I don't want to break your back today.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh and you and Fred anyways are doing the job. So no no need to repeat but just to know progress status.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah that's very helpful.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So the progress status um so TLDDR is basically okay we drafted a plan to consolidate both um portals we did it I created also another portal for the admin stuff right we will move all of the agents there um the potential to also manage membership from there which is SAS and all also the growth uh you know if you remember we discussed a lot about investor um you know understanding them and success success uh customer success metrics and how you can do marketing on them specifically that will be done from the admin uh portal so to say and so yeah I created all of the tables um that would allow to connect multiple personas not just investors to and basically staff I removed the terminology staff I changed a bunch of terminology that uh Fred asked me to um I created a lot of pages um that were not there for specific personas.
 
 
00:05:06
 
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So now you can log into um each and every persona. I have all of the stages and now what I'm doing is basically go through the user stories one by one uh from the document that Fred shared with me and I go to specific personas and test one by one and see if the page works correctly, if the back end works, the UI works and then I fix what is not fixed yet. And I've done it for a couple of personas right now and they still have to do it for commercial partner lawyer and still test everything from u you know test everything. Um so yeah um there is two levels to testing and
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: debugging. First it's okay make sure that um everything based on the user stories is implemented and then test the processes which means okay arranger uh dispatches to investor uh to lawyer to introduce to introducer and partner and see if the system tracks everything end to end until the commissions or the invoice is sent or um everything is done correctly right um yeah and integrating versus sign for each
 
 
00:06:15
 
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: persona.
Julien Machot: Oops.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for those that sign and also make it uh you know possible to have multiple signatories um so that has to be implemented and yeah so so far that's what I'm doing.
Julien Machot: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Julien Machot: very nice.
Fred Demargne: So on on um just to complete and that's that's good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Um
Fred Demargne: Uh I will need to review uh more in detail with you. U I don't know uh maybe today it would be great just to spend half an hour uh the testing environment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So you sent it to me yesterday.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uhhuh.
Fred Demargne: So I I need to I wanted what I mentioned to Julian I wanted to run some test unitary test myself so that I could get the support also of of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: Ashish uh to run some more tests but I just want to make sure that the basic flows uh work before uh before I I I get support from from Ashish on
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: this because otherwise it's going to we're going to waste time.
 
 
00:07:22
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: Um I'd like to Yeah. So I think uh what we need to do is to to catch up exactly what is what has been done, what is left.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: There was one small detail that maybe I will take the opportunity to have Julian on the line uh to reconfirm for you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: Um you know Julian told me that um for the issuance of the subscription pack uh you requested him to make it in a way so that the pack is not automatically sent to the investor but it's sent to the CEO meaning you or me
Julien Machot: Mhm. Mhm.
Fred Demargne: to adjust the contract even potentially and then uh click on it
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: so that click on the button that the the subscript subscription document is sent to the investor. Is it still what you want the platform to do?
Julien Machot: Yeah, I think we'll need it. I think we'll need it. Uh we'll need executive approval just to make sure that um we are
 
 
00:08:18
 
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Julien Machot: um yeah that we know exactly um what's happening. And the reason for this is because unfortunately in recent weeks before Christmas there'd been announcements coming out in the press about certain investments that were actually happening with us now. So we had clients locked up ready to go and sign immediately but then news come up and what happens is I have to basically call the shot, right? I have to make a commercial decision on whether or not we're going. Sometimes the commercial decision is also a legal decision, whether or not to engage. So yeah, I think we need it. It's almost like a kill switch for me rather than a rather than just controlling that the pack is okay, right? It's more like a kill switch if I need to. uh and maybe if there can be in that matter if for whatever reason I do not approve it, we need to have a way to communicate back on the reason why um the the subscription pack is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: rejected.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think last time we took the decision to do that, you explained to me that um the standard template for at least the examples you shared with me for the subscription pack um are not very standardized um templates in a way that the basic template always has to be edited a little bit.
 
 
00:10:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Maybe there is new clauses that you want to add specifically for the client from the lawyer. So it is edited every time and therefore the the work right now is done. You send it to the agent. Agent creates a document template right but it's in docs and it returns back to the subscription. So it is linked to the subscription and the CEO or maybe the arranger has to go there and check if um it is the final version. Click okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is final version and ready for signature which will send it to the investor and also for the CEO to sign.
Julien Machot: Yeah. There there are certain packs um where and we've seen it also in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: recent uh in the in the past couple of months there recent packs where especially the the way it worked is the lawyers of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: investor who's keen to proceed and keen to engage. The lawyer makes certain comments that are structural. They're really important.
 
 
00:11:08
 
Julien Machot: uh they're legally bearing. So for example uh one of them that we've seen which never
Ghiles Moussaoui: f******
Julien Machot: happened to us in the past was including um a new paragraph for an elevation right. An elevation right has a definition and that definition needed to be inserted because it's specifically is specifically negotiated with the subscriber with the investor. So yeah, so that's also one of the reasons why uh being able to edit and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: um and amend is important.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: But to be to be to be very concrete here, the way the process the process that you design will not uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,
Fred Demargne: address this point uh because uh before the before what you just explained the the document the first version of the document would have never been sent to the investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it will never be said.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh so that so that basically Julian will not know what the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: investor request. Uh but anyway I think for sake of simplicity uh I suggest that we keep the process
 
 
00:12:25
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: the way it is and then we will see whether we need to adapt it after the launch.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: But it gives at least the flexibility uh if we know that some specific changes that the
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: investor wants to include in a pack to to edit it. He also allows Julian to do the skill switch uh in a way that the contract will
Julien Machot: Yeah. Exactly.
Fred Demargne: never be sent. I'm sure that we will need to improve this process, but I think at the moment the most important thing is is to be ready for the launch.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: U so it's not the perfect solution,
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. Fred, you're right.
Fred Demargne: but it's it's a solution.
Julien Machot: Yeah, you're you're right. For the time being to keep it standard, right? That's what we're trying to do is to have is to have a subscription pack automatically generated based on the tables and the databases we have, right?
 
 
00:13:15
 
Julien Machot: And based on the inputs of the different uh parties. So then the gen the generation of that document is automated. So therefore for example the price per share is the price per share the number of shares that the client wants to buy is uh indicated by the client. So all of this is standardized at term at term there
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: should be when at term when the when the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: um investor or the lawyers or the investors receive a pack there should be maybe a way for them to click a few boxes to approve um or to be able to make one legal comment. um which would be then sent back again to us for review and maybe
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: that's a way the amendments in the future could be done. But for the time being, let's go standard because that's honestly that's uh 95% of the cases is standard.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Julien Machot: lucky enough.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, regarding the documents, uh when I created basically the templates for uh the currently NDA and also subscription pack, I did it from the examples that Julian shared with me.
 
 
00:14:40
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, I'm not sure if it is 100% correct. Right. So somebody has to check the
Fred Demargne: Yeah, know I know it's part it's part of the it's part of the testing that's uh I need to to lead
Ghiles Moussaoui: document.
Fred Demargne: here and that's why the starts for me the the testing process starts now uh and that's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: as important as the uh development. So um if we need to adjust some of the fields we will do it uh in the course of the week so that uh I understand on the web base is super easy to just update the template.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I don't see this as a as a major um issue on the critical path of the
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: launch.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um so and anyway you know every time we need to be able to
Julien Machot: And Fred, you
Fred Demargne: have and that's something that we can discuss in more detail really uh onetoone we need to be able to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: edit uh slightly the template for each investment opportunities.
 
 
00:15:33
 
Fred Demargne: Uh so I I don't think we should consider that there is one single template that applies for every single investment opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, okay. So, is that for the NDA or subscription pack?
Fred Demargne: was the subscription pack. I think the NDA is fairly standard across uh every any investment opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: is just a simple document saying well we don't we want to keep confidential information uh for a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: certain period of time but the subscription pack I think we need we we should have so we could have you know the
Julien Machot: Boom.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: way I was always designing it is there is a standard template for across any investment opportunity and then if we want to we can have a specific template that we can use for a particular investment opportunity there will not be major changes um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: don't get scared you know it's not a completely different document but there might be some you know uh simplification that we apply because we don't need some of the fields that um that will
 
 
00:16:35
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: just I'll explain to you in one to one it it is not a major change uh but I think it will give us some flexibility
Julien Machot: 95% plus. What happens is you have for a specific business we invest in specific
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Julien Machot: opportunity the subscription pack we create on day one is usually the same kept the same 95% plus of the throughout the life or throughout the uh the campaign. the changes that we may apply, simplifications, maybe adding one paragraph, you know, those will be less than 5% of changes. So, it's not, you know, it's it's not huge, but for a specific investor who's requesting something specific, that's what helps us close a deal, right? Um that's why the hit rate is higher than a firm like most
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: investment firms in reality. Uh and you can think of banks for example they will never accept to change their terms. They don't. Okay. Because for them to get a change of terms, it's such an expensive process and it's a long process.
 
 
00:17:53
 
Julien Machot: They have to go through the banker to the manager who goes to the legal department. Then legal in the same time has to check with compliance. Within six months they come back and they say, "Oh yeah, we can change one comma in the second paragraph." So obviously Verso doesn't do that, right? So Verso uh we are smaller a smaller firm um but we've always been hands-on and we've always said well okay well if a client is change is is asking for a minor change we will take the subscription pack and we will literally write up ourself that minor change. Therefore, instead of taking 6 months, it takes us 10 minutes and we close the deal. That's the spirit of the change. But it's never fundamental. It's a minor change only.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: So, Fred will walk you through this when need be.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: No worries.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is this per category of investment opportunity or per investment opportunity specifically?
Julien Machot: So,
Fred Demargne: very
Julien Machot: so per investment opportunity because um it it's so right
 
 
00:18:58
 
Fred Demargne: investment.
Julien Machot: now we've always worked per per investment opportunity per vehicle, right? If you remember. So really that subscription document is relate is rooted to that specific investment opportunity. Now uh what's adding complexity obviously is that we are not a mono product. So every investment opportunity is a product for us.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: That's what I call an issuance right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand.
Julien Machot: So if I invest 20 times, well imagine I have 20 products, but in reality in my 20 products instead of having only 20 subscription packs as templates, I might have a hundred because I wanted to close more deals with more people. Um so yeah, so we keep that flexibility
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Julien Machot: on.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I need I need to think on how to implement this. Either somebody does it on a manual thing from a draft or uh we add some um because it's per investment opportunity. So we can programmatically put it directly for the current investment opportunities. But every single time we create one, let's say there is a 5% chance, we have to either create a separate template for it,
 
 
00:20:14
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: but we have to do it for each investment opportunity every time. If it's not um deterministic, if it's not, you know, predetermined uh by maybe a type or a specific
Fred Demargne: No, it's it's it's relatively straightforward.
Ghiles Moussaoui: problem.
Fred Demargne: It's you have a standard template that apply for every investment opportunity unless a specific
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: template is specified.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: That's as simple as
Ghiles Moussaoui: And okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And with Fred um so from the user stories um I I think there is small
Fred Demargne: that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: gaps uh because you take that into you know you put it into the digital ecosystem. There is uh gaps of business logic that we have to you know we have to um test and also maybe develop because um you know you have to link a lot of things together especially if many personas are involved in a specific deal or transaction. Um I would like to you know understand how it works more in details
Julien Machot: Yeah.
 
 
00:21:24
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: but I think we can catch up on that later.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Julien Machot: Perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And okay.
Julien Machot: Perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, uh, regarding the lunch, right? So, how many um people are we approximately inviting? Are they mostly investors or is there uh I guess for
Julien Machot: Okay. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Julien Machot: so uh that's a Okay. Okay. So, let's talk about the next step in terms of the when when we when
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: we start on January 10, the vision I have for it is that um every single investor who is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: today so what I call an investor is a client who's today registered with us who has an account who has invested at least once. So they appear at least one time in a vehicle in a specific investment opportunity and they had at some point obviously subscribed and they wired funds at some point historically.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So I want to be able to capture 100% of our clients of our investors.
 
 
00:22:32
 
Julien Machot: I want to make sure that no one's left aside.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: I want to make sure that we're going to have um at the launch day on January 10, 100% of our um clients will be um invited uh to to to well first will hear about the news and discover that Verso has this incredible announcement. We're launching our own platforms, private platforms for our clients called Verso Tech. and they're invited to log into their accounts and from now on this will be the main medium for their interactions with Verso. It will be the main way by which they check their past, present and future investments. That will be the main way they contact our team. They can ask questions. They can request support. they can monitor any due diligence or any performance that's happening. So this is the the for me um a crucial part of this exercise. Uh there Fred and I had discussed that there are um there are some carveouts. There are some of our investors who may not be included initially in this batch in this particular launch for historical reasons.
 
 
00:24:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Fred is still working on that. But but everyone else I want to be able to say that they're logged in.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: And I'll give you an example. The people who go into VC106 who are asking me for reports
Ghiles Moussaoui: Say hi
Julien Machot: about that company every quarter. It's been now many years they've been invested.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: There are lots of people by the way. They're more than I think 100 uh people. It's a lot to manage. I want to make sure that all these people finally hear that there's a solution for them. Everything is automated from now on. Uh Fred,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: is that is that fair?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Is that a good representation of what we're trying to say and
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. So I think uh completely aligning with this uh J I think to to to be more to be very
Julien Machot: do?
Fred Demargne: specific um uh I think we're going to have u probably I would say the other man will be around 1,000 investors uh that
 
 
00:25:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: we should we should plan for uh we're going to have um uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: partners I think partners will be maybe around 10 uh the order of magnitude 10 or 20 No more. Um, then we're going to have a lawyer. I think for the start we're going to have one person as a lawyer, which is our main lawyer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Fred Demargne: Uh, no, sorry, sorry. Two, two or three.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Use
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry. Is it one law firm with members or is it multiple? Uh okay.
Fred Demargne: two or three law firms.
Julien Machot: multiple
Fred Demargne: Two or three law firms with multiple users in each firms.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Interesting.
Julien Machot: record.
Fred Demargne: Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: so I think two for sure. Uh, and maybe a third one uh will be up to Jan to
Julien Machot: Yeah, we I may I may add up Robert Fenner at T Westing.
Fred Demargne: decide.
Julien Machot: I want to add up Chris Harvey in Los Angeles.
 
 
00:25:56
 
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Julien Machot: Harvey is choir. We'll have Dupon Partners Luxmbourg which is our main law firm today. Matthew and Met Dupon and his team I think in Spain as well.
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Julien Machot: No, don't you have someone to add up in Spain too for the
Fred Demargne: Yeah. I mean,
Julien Machot: NPL?
Fred Demargne: yeah, I don't know if we're going to at the launch. I don't know if we're going to have them, but they are not um I don't think we will put them as lawyers. I need to think about it. I I know exactly what you mean,
Julien Machot: H okay those guys. Okay.
Fred Demargne: but
Julien Machot: But I I for sure I have at least three or four law firms I want and and real uh this is a
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Julien Machot: big chunk of the business development for vers. So I'm going to start bringing more law firms to to to back us up in the business in the near future. But to start there will be at least three I think.
 
 
00:26:45
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: and and com commercial partners arranger there would be uh maybe two max for the moment.
Julien Machot: 50.
Fred Demargne: Uh one is virtual management limited but I think Julian you just started to have one more uh for one
Julien Machot: Um,
Fred Demargne: specific investment opportunity.
Julien Machot: so wait uh as as what as introducer or arranger? Okay, so versal management as an arranger uh to start. That's right. That's the only one because it's the exclusive official one.
Fred Demargne: Arena.
Julien Machot: But we will uh Met Dupon told me that we could consider having an an arrangement license in Luxembourg uh that would be very similar to the BVI one and so this is something I need to consider but for the get-go one virtual management and then we'll diversify All
Fred Demargne: Okay. And then the last the last persona is a commercial partner.
Julien Machot: right.
Fred Demargne: I think here I need to think um how we going to manage this uh for the launch uh because there is some additional complexity uh with banks.
 
 
00:27:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I need to I need to confirm to that but it will not be many uh maybe the mag will be between 10 and 20 no
Julien Machot: And introducers.
Fred Demargne: more in introducer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Introducers. Do they?
Fred Demargne: So they would be maybe 100 maximum
Julien Machot: Yeah, there there may be there may be quite a bunch of introducers.
Fred Demargne: uh
Julien Machot: I think core core introducers will have probably something like 20 of them, but we'll have to we'll have to go through the list maybe together. So I can tell you who's who's who do we want to invite actually. Then if you have the admin rights, we can just add introducer. We can always uh add later introducers there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: But to launch like there will be at least uh maybe 20. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I mean
Julien Machot: And so each for each one of these personas the welcome message uh it will be more or less the same welcome message. Right. It's just that maybe the welcome message for the investors is a little bit more specific because I really want the language to be clear and say verse is becoming your medium for working with us.
 
 
00:29:00
 
Julien Machot: This is where we do things together.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: This is where the world gets together just like a Shopify is a platform for all
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: e-commerce users, right? Uh and actors. So, Verso Tech will be that platform for for them going
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So,
Julien Machot: forward.
Ghiles Moussaoui: a couple of things for me. Um, first we need to set up a domain, right, for verse.com or any maybe Versa Holdings to your route to the
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: website. So, we need to set that up. Uh we need then to I think we need to purchase the superbase account for now. I've been using the free one for testing more specific.
Julien Machot: Okay. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So we have to get that and
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um
Fred Demargne: Can you build can you build a to-do list for the launch document uh so that we can
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah we can for
Fred Demargne: exchange uh maybe on notion that would be easier so that we can we can
 
 
00:29:55
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: sure. Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: check the u the action to be done and who does the which action so that we can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: track this cleanly and and efficiently.
Julien Machot: and and guys uh so the verse.com belongs to us.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Exist.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Fred Demargne: too.
Julien Machot: So I'll need to send you the Wix access.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Did I did I actually send you the Wix access before? I don't remember. Maybe I did. No. Okay. So, I'll send you the Wix access. It's a general admin. I've got all the websites I've ever worked on and built. And so,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: and and we agree that uh versholdings.com, which is our main uh you know, it's it's a very basic website, right? Nothing's happening there. It's just basically um yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: it's just for showcase, let's say, right? Um we will have this button I've inserted.
 
 
00:30:51
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: I I think you saw it. I've inserted a blue uh ticker,
Ghiles Moussaoui: login.
Julien Machot: like a blue V ticker at the top. Uh I hope it's still there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Um since I was sick.
Fred Demargne: It was when the last time I saw Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,
Julien Machot: you saw
Ghiles Moussaoui: can you see my screen?
Julien Machot: it.
Fred Demargne: last time last time I checked last week, I think it was still there. I went to the website to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Oh,
Ghiles Moussaoui: It takes
Fred Demargne: see
Julien Machot: okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: versote.com/lander.
Julien Machot: So we so basically what I wanted to do is make sure that we have a simple access uh through the versholdings.com people who want to sort of who are
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: not maybe getting used to verse right away will not get lost they can click and be redirected so that's a simple redirection then on verse.com of course um so if we can keep the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:31:45
 
Julien Machot: wix because it's just simpler for me it's just very Easy. Uh uh uh in terms of design u of the of the of the landing, we just need a landing page, right? We don't need anything else, right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the I have landing page I just created uh fast you know I can change it in an hour it doesn't take much time you can see it in my screen.
Julien Machot: It's easy, right? Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And so
Julien Machot: So I guess once I launch the uh once once I give you today the access to Wix, you're you're comfortable you're comfortable working on Wix or or do you or do you want one of my guys to do it for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I don't remember last time I worked on
Julien Machot: you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Wix but I will see.
Julien Machot: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So what needs to be done in W specifically?
Julien Machot: it's basically drag and drop. It's super super simple drag and drop type pages.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: There's very limited AI at the moment on it.
 
 
00:32:43
 
Julien Machot: I had uh well before I got sick I I was aiming to finish the page myself, but I yeah then it went to s***.
Fred Demargne: Julian,
Julien Machot: But basically um we can finish it real
Fred Demargne: may I may I suggest that we use um the Nickno was the guy
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: quick.
Fred Demargne: that was working on it instead because I think would have a lot to do while we are doing the testing.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. No, I I've got I got to go.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um,
Julien Machot: I got a guy Tom who's been it's Tom Tom in the UK. Yeah. Who's been following us for many years now and Tom has been doing those latest changes.
Fred Demargne: okay.
Julien Machot: He will do it for us. So if you want to sort of uh Yeah, I I'll put you in touch with him. It's easier. The two of you can chat briefly and then you'll create the artworks we need.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, okay. Yeah.
 
 
00:33:31
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, so what do you think about the landing page? Like what needs to be inside so I
Julien Machot: Um yeah, I think that it needs to be um fairly actually fairly similar to
Ghiles Moussaoui: know
Julien Machot: the Versal Holdings uh landing page with a way for people to get a feel right away on what's going on, you know. So um in versal holding the strategy was to have a huge splash so people can see headlines to see that we're active right that's the main idea so when they come onto Verso tech what do want what do we want them to see we want them to see that verse is AI powered investment banking AI powered investment
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: banking this is tech It's fintech. Clearly fintech. And I want I want them to be able to create an account,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: log in. Super efficient or request additional information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: I don't need or I don't want any uh additional content or text ready. Just super focused on just driving people through it.
 
 
00:34:49
 
Julien Machot: Um yeah maybe do you want to welcome investors and introducer
Fred Demargne: I think Tom I
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: think
Julien Machot: um in the login just just maybe just a simple login right because you said it's all
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: one platform now right one login simplified
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, one login as you can see unified portal
Fred Demargne: but I think I think we need to think I mean the first thing will be the sign up Um and here we need to I need to spend some time with you to know exactly how we're going to differentiate the different type of uh of persona uh from that very moment. Uh so I think the login is relative to straightforward because the system will automatically recognize who what persona is connecting once the account has been created. Uh I think what we need to what we need to think about is a sign up.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think it's a bit more
Julien Machot: Right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So currently um there is an invite thing directly from the platform.
 
 
00:35:38
 
Fred Demargne: important.
Ghiles Moussaoui: as a CEO, you can go invite uh people and that sends an email to them uh with
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the template you created last time. They click on there, they go to um this kind of login uh page where they have to put their you know create a password for the account and then they can login once they have that right for sign in I mean sign up directly I'm not sure um it's still working. I blocked it with the system but they can just let it happen because I thought okay we the CEO has to create an account for somebody and invite them. they can't just invite themselves and get into the platform. Uh I think before it was for the investor. Now we have multiple personas. So we have I guess to think about it a
Julien Machot: I I think I think it could be just a to create your account.
Ghiles Moussaoui: lot.
Julien Machot: Um, anyone who clicks on it, so they're going to land on a on a welcome page.
 
 
00:36:42
 
Julien Machot: It's going to uh ask them to choose their profile.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Who are they? Are they an investor,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: individual, corporate, institutional? or is it a lawyer law firm who wants to work with Verso Tech?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Is it or is working with a client and they're going to have to put their credentials basically?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Julien Machot: Um,
Fred Demargne: I think I think what what what was trying to say is at the moment it's it's invitation only. Uh so we know we know exactly what persona is uh uh the user.
Julien Machot: yeah.
Fred Demargne: So maybe maybe we can stick to this for the launch. It's invitation only and then once after we launched then we can open up and have
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: a more open way to get uh to create an account in the
Julien Machot: I think I think we cannot just do that because uh there's certain of our
Fred Demargne: platform.
Julien Machot: clients once they see the platform start to log in they may be also pushing it forwarding it to another client another friend of theirs.
 
 
00:37:43
 
Julien Machot: You may have already some generation of new contacts from the get-go. Um remember there are also uh husbands and wives who have invested and the husband's going to forward to his wife and maybe we do not have the wife in our records.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,
Julien Machot: So I think we're going to have to have a sign up available from the from January 10 and activated with a simple form. Make it as simple if you want, as simple as you wish. And then we will contact each and every person to understand who they are.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: So we just need the email the email and the name and then and then we need to qualify
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.
Fred Demargne: one by one before we open up the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. So what I'm thinking about is is this something to do with uh the
Fred Demargne: account.
Ghiles Moussaoui: members of a specific account uh like Julian said okay husband and wife does that mean it is one investment account as entity and they have members inside because what I'm thinking of and we discussed it with Fred uh for now I think it's present for specific personas um you can go into your profile and invite in invite members right to sign up and creator only because they have to be
 
 
00:39:04
 
Julien Machot: That's right. That's right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: signaries,
Julien Machot: So, yeah, that's a good point actually. Once they're in, once we know the user is actually activating his account and using it and they can
Ghiles Moussaoui: right?
Julien Machot: have an option, as you said, because we discussed this before, where they can invite participants in, then you're right. it could solve our problem just from the launch and just from a a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: lead capture point of view.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: We just need a basic sign in I think for this time being and then maybe one of our agents will be the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: one qualifying who these people are whether they're worthy of having an account or
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Julien Machot: not.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now I'm thinking about it. I think they could be you know if I'm understanding correctly uh there is a possibility to put something um okay something like request access button for people that don't have an account right then you can approve it
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: internally and if you want okay to be able to invite that person they have to
 
 
00:40:05
 
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: request access or maybe terminology sign up or like wait list where they have to put their email and once you approve them. This will send to their email an invite link like the other people that you invited through the platform and that would um allow them to create a password
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's a good idea.
Ghiles Moussaoui: and
Julien Machot: I like that. It's a good idea. The request access is a good idea because we are not Facebook,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Julien Machot: right? This is not the Facebook of finance.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: It is a professional tool. It is a professional investment banking platform. So, you're actually right. request access implies exactly what I want people to know is that we are open for business but to come in the club you've got to be admitted and accepted first so request access is very
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And the other thing is data.
Julien Machot: good
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I know for an investor the basic data met the data of each investor but there is uh for example multiple personas now and I don't know if there is specific agreements with introducers that I have to put in what kind of format uh specifically for the launch right because if we're inviting people for the investor okay their subscription from the dashboard we have to import but uh what about the other personas and also the vehicles I have a list I'm not sure if it is complete or it's missing
 
 
00:41:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: metadata or data and also for the deals so most of the deals I created is for testing created them myself from the vehicles so has that has to be um defined I guess
Julien Machot: Um so um okay so for for lawyer for arranger is very easy because it's reversal management for lawyers um um it's also very
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: easy because there service providers ers principally to versal management. So again that relationship is quite straightforward. Uh where it gets tricky is for our introducers.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Commercial partners too but commercial partners are a little bit more uh institutional and corporates. For introducers, it's a it's it's not easy because do we do we link up uh do we link up in our system the introducers to the investors from day one? Is that the link that we have in database or not
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, we we can put it uh an introducer can be both an investor and introducer they have
Julien Machot: really?
Ghiles Moussaoui: two accounts they can switch from if it is linked as investor I think a partner as well.
 
 
00:43:00
 
Julien Machot: Fred,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Julien Machot: do you do you do you know do you know if we have
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Julien Machot: mapped our introducers for every investor or we've done it partly? you
Fred Demargne: That's now that uh normally is done.
Julien Machot: think?
Fred Demargne: That's why I'm pissing you off all the time by asking you to link
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's right.
Fred Demargne: it.
Julien Machot: I know. You break my balls all the time. Uh, so so it should be
Fred Demargne: So no normally normally it's it is linked and I think I need to
Julien Machot: done.
Fred Demargne: review what has done based on the requirement but this is this was important to make sure that uh the when when there is an introducer it's defined as an introducer from the very moment where the profile is created and therefore uh I think I think we're going to need an agent to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh back link all the introducer to the existing
Julien Machot: Okay.
Fred Demargne: investment and and then moving forward the new um
 
 
00:43:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, yes.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: the new in the new investment opportunity uh there will be an association at the moment where uh we dispatch an investment opportunity that was a plan
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: that was a requirement
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. So um for the agent uh because it will do that for multiple data I guess for investor and their subscriptions I think introducers their uh investors and introduced are also investors right because let's say we put an investor account but they are also an introducer we have to link their account right so we will either use a name or I don't know how it would work. The agent is done once. So I will do it uh I will use an an agent that so what I would need is a spreadsheet or something like that makes it easier to take it give it to the agent uh you know I have also to define the schema and then inject it inside the database with the staging uh place to make sure everything fits and then somebody has to check
 
 
00:45:11
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the data
Fred Demargne: Yeah, that's the plan.
Julien Machot: Um Fred there Fred there's one thing sorry
Fred Demargne: Yes. So, there's a Google s***.
Julien Machot: Fred one one one uh consideration um
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Julien Machot: historically uh conducting the business I've never distinguished the different types of introducers but what happens is we know we have introducers and then we have what I would call regulated parties right they also do introductions, for example, brokerage firms, right? And and banks, those institutions, will you qualify them as commercial partners? That's what we said we would do, right?
Fred Demargne: No, a broker. No, a broker. Broker.
Julien Machot: No.
Fred Demargne: That's something that I think we need to work post launch. Um what what a commercial partner for me is um uh UBS is BT patrol uh where is is playing a role of either under a discretionary mandate or an execution only mandate. So you either know the investors behind or you don't know. Uh that's what the commercial partner was defined.
 
 
00:46:28
 
Julien Machot: Well, you're not going to you're not going to want you're not going to want the broker dealers who are
Fred Demargne: Uh
Julien Machot: regulated. They're regulated firms. You're not going to want them in that category. They're going to remain as introducers.
Fred Demargne: no, they will be either considered as introducer at the launch and then I think we're going to need to differentiate them afterwards uh because technically there are additional things that needs to be done for the
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: broker which is not done for introducer and also for the reconciliation.
Julien Machot: Okay. Okay.
Fred Demargne: and so on is different.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I think I think I this is kind of things I need to to look at in more detail for the launch. But in the worst case scenario,
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: we can define them as introducer if you
Julien Machot: Yeah. Because the the way the way I'm sensing the business is is
Fred Demargne: want.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: going is uh introducers who tend to be mostly individuals giving you the name of a friend recommending another investor to get a commission.
 
 
00:47:33
 
Julien Machot: These are parties who are usually not regulated and it's not necessary that you have repeated business with them. So a lot of these a lot of these people they introduce once and then they flutter away. Uh that's usually the most case. Um as the business hopefully will mature with the use of such a platform. Uh Fred, you'll have to account for the broker dealers and you'll need to decide what you do with them because they are opening doors, right? I I have forged incredible institutional relationships with three or four of them in the US. Uh one of them is now listed also and uh they they are now becoming very regular partners for us. They will be also your partners for growing the platform and the business. So this is just a side comment for now.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Julien Machot: Not not crucial for January
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um all right. Okay.
Julien Machot: 10.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I think we can what we can do is we have to define the work uh that needs to be done both from testing and also from my side to finish what needs to be finished um before January 10 and they need I think there will be work afterwards right there will all be edge cases um so
 
 
00:48:54
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah I think we have to define
Julien Machot: I um and and um so once once I get
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: into my account as an investor for example uh we need to have
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: a bit of a walkway a bit of a guide to show me key functions. So we need to think about this what we going to do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Do you want to generate a a small tutorial video of the key functions? sort of easy start, you know, zero to one road map like a road map or and of course um um I if um if you could have a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: uh an assistant for support inside the app which can uh help the user navigate through that will help the user guide the user to where they need to go and click um uh automated
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: chat bots. Now it's quite common.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, we do it
Julien Machot: Uh last but not least um which is another point of
Ghiles Moussaoui: against
 
 
00:50:09
 
Julien Machot: importance. If I'm an investor and I log in, what do I really see when I come in? So there are two parts that I'm I'm I think are crucial. Number one is the profile and compliance aspects. I think we determined that the investor will have to log in and update their details like passports,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Julien Machot: utility bills. So, we will need agents there. And we'll discuss this tomorrow, guys,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: but we'll need agents to support this workload. I don't want Fred to end up doing uh a thousand uh a thousand KYC updates manually. That's going to be a nightmare. And then the investor also wants to see the uh current investments they hold with us. So we'll need to be very careful on those two fronts.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Compliance and current portfolio with the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I think there is also hidden details.
Julien Machot: investments.
Ghiles Moussaoui: For example, for all of the subscription they have, we need to, you know, the investment they have, we need to identify the status of it.
 
 
00:51:19
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: and therefore um see if for example they have signed the subscription pack do we import that subscription pack or do we regenerate it their uh NDAs as well and also for example the certificate right because if they hold an investment they have a certificate do we regenerate it do we import it inside the platform um
Julien Machot: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: absolutely. So you guys uh Fred and you if you can work together making sure those aspects are covered because on the day of the launch any investor so here's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: our mission that's a KPI on the day of the launch there are two or three things that need to happen number one the investor discovers the platform with our message invit invitation message they log in they see wow Wow. The front page, the dashboard. Wow,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Julien Machot: I can see stuff happening. Quickly, they're going to check their profile. Quickly, they're going to check their current holdings and investments with us. When they click, they must find what they know they have.
 
 
00:52:33
 
Julien Machot: So, if I have invested three times with Julian, a SpaceX, uh, a real estate deal, and one more thing, I want to see those three things in my portfolio for sure. If I have any doubt or any questions, I want to be able to click on an assistant that's visibly somewhere at the bottom of the page and I can click and I can write whatever I need to write and I know there's assistance from our team. We will all be logged in. We'll all be eyeing what's going on. I want to make sure day one is a success. We're going to win. We need to win our users back again because this is the first time they're going to come in and we need to show them where basically the platform is working,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Julien Machot: right?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah, I think it makes sense. Um it's a conversion battery
Julien Machot: Yeah, exactly. Um, do we have the login?
Ghiles Moussaoui: investors.
Julien Machot: We're going to have um the logs so we'll know pretty much what's going on at all times.
 
 
00:53:38
 
Julien Machot: You remember like a bit like a big brother type. Uh, be able to spy on the whole activities of the platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh yeah so everything is inside the database right so even if it doesn't have the UI
Julien Machot: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: um you know it will be created later or you could log into the database or you could tell me and they could get the data Um there is multiple logs.
Julien Machot: So I think from from the from January 10
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Julien Machot: uh January 9 midnight we need to know that all these data collection automatic logs uh monitoring controlling
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: slash security uh protection encryption and security, we need to be on, right? We need to be live and on and make sure that we have a good a good grip on the entire platform. And then uh of course as we learn and as we uh grow uh this business uh you and I can go and Fred will go deeper into what exactly we need for compliance,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: for security, for maneuverability, for uh checking data samples, for verifying um a specific user case.
 
 
00:55:03
 
Julien Machot: If there's if there's for example a legal case against us or we press charges against someone who has been using the platform, we will able to have a trail of audits uh to see if we can use the data to protect us and and make our case stronger. So we need to be very careful always. Remember it's a risky business. It's a business where we're prone to being sued or suing others. So, we need to make sure our platform will give us all the logs we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: need.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: It's our super CIA Langly platform. We need to know what's going on, right? So, if people are lying to us on compliance matters,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: imagine there's a money laundering scandal and we've but touch wood. We've never had a single major MLR report for money laundering against us. But if if if one day there's a there's a case, we need to be able to put out everything we have about the user and what the user did.
 
 
00:56:15
 
Julien Machot: It's very important.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
Julien Machot: Okay. Um Okay, great.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We have to define the type of login that need to
Julien Machot: Hey. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: have. Yeah. For now, it's I think basics what needs to be like for example the staging of investments,
Julien Machot: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh the actions um of the investor, the KYC document. Uh because everything is stored inside the database, you can make sense of it and also create um say journeys inside and see
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: what investors do on a daily base when they're logged
Julien Machot: Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So for January 10,
Ghiles Moussaoui: in.
Julien Machot: uh guys, do you see any other major point? Oh, yeah. I know, I know. I know. How do we do do should we plan to communicate uh also to the public at large or do we keep it internal first sort of our clients
Fred Demargne: We we keep it until I recommend because if we see uh if we see things that needs to be
 
 
00:57:22
 
Julien Machot: okay
Fred Demargne: improved is better we keep it between ourselves
Julien Machot: okay we keep it low
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: first.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I say yeah I say internal um it's also way it's a first time
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: investors come and test right so there will be refactoring of features maybe or building new stuff and um yeah I think then we can start on boarding new
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: people
Julien Machot: Okay. So, we're not going Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: more.
Julien Machot: fine. So, we're keeping it for our business. We're not talking about PR. We're not talking about marketing campaigns. We're not going to blast the web on this. Okay. All
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean um you can use it as um marketing
Julien Machot: right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: edge, right? Remember all of the agents we created for LinkedIn?
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I have him here. So the connection requests reaching out to the people scraping sales navigator for leads and the cold email system right so we could use
 
 
00:58:26
 
Julien Machot: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that for example for marketing later if you remember you shared with me also a list of prospects we did
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: not get to it yet um
Julien Machot: Okay. Sorry, that's actually a very good point.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh since there's so many complex elements, it's uh uh it's popping up. So, uh yes, no active marketing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Agreed. We keep the launch and the announcement. uh specific and internal to our own investors identified parties
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hey
Julien Machot: only. However, real you will be starting on January 10 uh the LinkedIn agents uh and the marketing uh uh uh marketing indeed right and and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: scraping. So we will start. So how many can can you remind me and remind all of us how many uh contacts per day can you can you scrape and
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for the script it can be unlimited but it the cost scales
Julien Machot: analyze.
Ghiles Moussaoui: with it and also uh it depends on okay how many do you want to reach out to per day.
 
 
00:59:41
 
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The standard per one LinkedIn account is about 20 to 30 if you're doing out LinkedIn a day and per email.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for each inbox that you have you would say similarly 30 to 40 a day right. So could send thousands thousands a day but you have to have therefore multiple
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: inboxes and someone has to face the inboxes after they answer right.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for conversion uh stuff you would like to answer leads uh fast right? So if you send thousands a day you need a system or SDRs for that could be done with agents but um it's still something to consider and for the scraping alone you can do easily um a thousand to 10,000 a day. uh but it's the same thing because I think the outreach is uh where um it gets stuck because you have to spend more if you want to send more right but
Julien Machot: Thank you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the scraping is done fairly easily and the data enrichment also is sometimes costly uh we do it through clay but the data enrichment we have right now is for content information only say you want to scrape their website or their pain points
 
 
01:00:57
 
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: or something like that that would cost also for web scraping. Uh but
Julien Machot: Okay. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Julien Machot: Uh you remember all the prospects leads databases at sent like there were so many of these files.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Have you managed to sort of digitalize all this and put them into your general database just the prospect database?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh no, not yet. I've been working on the platform uh for last months.
Julien Machot: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So at some point by Jan 10 if you can.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All
Julien Machot: So I'd love to have my compilation of all the contacts of all these databases for prospection because we will start working with that as well. Okay. It's peripheral to the platform.
Fred Demargne: there need to be then before we launch this we need to make sure it's
Ghiles Moussaoui: right.
Julien Machot: We will need it.
Fred Demargne: linked to the to our CRM tools because otherwise it's going to be so
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: inefficient uh moving forward so we need to make sure that all of this is is is linked to our CRM tool with the customer base because for me if I mean I just to be clear this is
 
 
01:02:02
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: completely separate from the platform that we are building but it's complimementaryary and I think that's if
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: we can make it I think it would be
Julien Machot: Yeah. Yeah. We have right because and I we talked about this a while back.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: nice
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: So we have realiz you have all the all the databases you have. It's really to bring them to your first layer database which is the general prospect database.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: It's not CRM yet. And only from there whenever like from January 10
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Julien Machot: work's going to start. I want to make sure that we start having some business development and prospection elements automatically starting so we can start building our pipeline. We and Fred will be able to start getting hopefully new accounts, new new uh users will pop up and hopefully some of them will be high quality.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So um the GTM engineering I think is better done via okay you would like to have like an external database where you hold the uh save the leads and I think it it is pretty um
 
 
01:03:21
 
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's better to have only the prospects where you have had a point of contact with them or maybe they entered the funnel um stored inside
Julien Machot: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the CRM otherwise you will have thousands and thousands of lead in this year. Um, so yeah,
Julien Machot: Yeah, that's what we said.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that's what I
Julien Machot: I remember you said that. So, if you can by the 10th of January,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: uh maybe one of the last things on your list, but um I want to be ready. I want to be ready. We need to have cuz we've got I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of emails we have where we don't need to go and scrape the internet. We have them. So it's just a matter of then deciding our policy to start qualifying them. Yeah. Okay. Amazing. Uh any other point guys or we're good for today?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so yeah um so there is the agents
 
 
01:04:21
 
Julien Machot: I think it's okay now. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right the which are connected to the processes tab I talked with Fred last time. He told me, okay, processes should be in admin portal, right? So, we're not inside the CEO or arranger,
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: but admin. Um, so yeah, there is the a couple it makes sense. So, subscription pack, the NDA, um, reporting.
Julien Machot: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh I don't know how we have to you know think about how do we put the reporting agent in there it will evolve especially the trigger
Julien Machot: So reporting agent uh you and I had discussed that the the most important thing
Ghiles Moussaoui: and
Julien Machot: was uh that they the if you remember per investments there was a different chronology for the reports a different timing for the reports if you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: recall Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So we are quarterly all of that
Julien Machot: correct. So the agents will be activated on January 10.
Ghiles Moussaoui: monthly.
Julien Machot: From that moment, uh they will start their work.
 
 
01:05:35
 
Julien Machot: So no,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: understandably the very first reports that are going to come about will be end of January for some of them or end of March for some of them for the majority.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Julien Machot: Um so that's going to be activated for sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Julien Machot: Uh and what we can do is if you have some time tomorrow or
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Julien Machot: or or Sunday, I'd love to have another session where we can go agent per agent and verify exactly again exactly the tasks they are covering. Um I have created those personas, avatars uh with uh faces if you remember and names. They have like real names and they have a compliance role or marketing role or operations. I want to use those in the platform with their faces with their photos.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Julien Machot: So when they interact with users, it's like it's like my photo pops up, right? they interact, people can see them and they have specific titles and responsibilities that will help Fred organize his troops as well.
 
 
01:06:46
 
Julien Machot: So if you have time tomorrow or Sunday, love to invite you to reconnect and we just spend you know the 10 or 10 minutes required per agent. What workload does this employee does? What workload that agent does for us? And uh we'll need to try to cover uh uh as much as uh as much as
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Julien Machot: possible.
Fred Demargne: Can could we um could we do this call on Monday,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Jian, that we progress on the um on the first level of testing over the weekend?
Julien Machot: Yeah, look,
Fred Demargne: Uh me I've got u Yeah.
Julien Machot: that's fine with me. You guys can organize the way you want.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Julien Machot: Uh I just have it on the to-do list.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Julien Machot: Uh at some point, we need to get that done.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Julien Machot: This is our army of of workers,
Fred Demargne: And I'm I'm missing I think I think we are on the testing.
Julien Machot: right?
Fred Demargne: Um we are missing couple of stuff.
 
 
01:07:43
 
Fred Demargne: So I need to speak to you maybe right after the call now just to clarify with you. I I don't see any other point.
Julien Machot: Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh I think I think now Julian we just need to build the plan uh because it's starting
Julien Machot: Perfect. Amazing. Okay. Why don't you guys go on?
Fred Demargne: now.
Julien Machot: Uh let me let me release you. You guys go on.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. All right. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Thank my my
Ghiles Moussaoui: Thanks.
Fred Demargne: my Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: So, I wanted to ask you a couple of things. Um I cannot log in uh properly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: I think there are issue with the cookies or something on the on the testing
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh,
Fred Demargne: environment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.
Fred Demargne: Uh so now I'm completely blocked. I cannot even click on sign in. But before I could sign in and then and then the page was kind of almost like if you know the cookie page was supposed to appear were not appearing it was telling me real time dashboard uh connected or whatever I don't remember but I was not able to browse into the page so there must be a I started with
 
 
01:09:16
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Which account you see?
Fred Demargne: a CEO but I had the same issue with the arranger when I tried
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, let me try it right
Fred Demargne: I'm using
Ghiles Moussaoui: now.
Fred Demargne: Chrome
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, say co. So, for me, I think it it logs in. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: we do go in.
Fred Demargne: It's a problem of button. It's a problem of navigation. It's not a problem of access.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh,
Fred Demargne: Right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: navigation. So, where are you specifically?
Fred Demargne: Verso tag.lovers.app. I'm at the very beginning when I I try to click on sign in nothing happens. Uh before it was working but then the dash I was lending to the dashboard and the dashboard was I couldn't do anything on the dashboard was completely so I think I think it's mostly a cookie or something
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you try the link I sent in the chat right
Fred Demargne: issue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: now? the I think maybe the link. Um, when did you try last time?
 
 
01:10:24
 
Fred Demargne: I was trying to move.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, I will.
Fred Demargne: Let me see where is it chat and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me try.
Fred Demargne: okay from my phone because I was calling from the phone. I've got redirection uh up.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I click on sign in. And I will use a CEO for instance
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, should I send you credentials?
Fred Demargne: what I'm just watching on my
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you know the credential? Should I send it to you in the chat?
Fred Demargne: laptop at the same time I have
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: here
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I just tried it in Chrome in another browser and it works for me. Um, isn't maybe it's a RAM thing. Do you have multiple things open?
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I've got multiple pages open here on my uh one
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it could be a RAM.
Fred Demargne: second. I've got notification things. Yeah, the prime on the phone is it's it's at the moment I need to make some adjustment because the the menu on the
 
 
01:11:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: left is completely uh fixed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. Uh yeah,
Fred Demargne: So I cannot I cannot do it for my phone.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I
Fred Demargne: Let me see if I can click on buttons.
Ghiles Moussaoui: didn't
Fred Demargne: No. Yes. On my phone the button works. So I can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: browse.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's a RAM thing because it's uh it takes more RAM than other tabs, right? Just because it has more multiple features, multiple pages, multiple tabs, multiple things you can do. So automatically when you open it, it takes more things like um Google Docs or Gmail, more resources
Fred Demargne: But how come it gets stuck? I mean it cannot get stuck if if if an investor connect and you already have several pages
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: open.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: We need to make sure that this is uh this is not uh being impacted.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: Now I moved it to a different window on Chrome and it seems to be unblocking it.
 
 
01:12:39
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: Let me try to log in on my laptop. We use the arranger.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I remove the Google um sign, you know, continue with Google feature?
Fred Demargne: What do you mean?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Well, when you go to sign up feature, there is a Google button, Google icon that you could use, but for now, I think it's not implemented.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: to sign up.
Fred Demargne: maybe maybe take it out. Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: if if it's causing one of the issue,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think it's better not to have it. Yeah, because people can put their login and and typing in their email address and stuff.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So, it's not a big deal. Yeah. When I create when I open the page on a different uh window,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: it works. Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.
Fred Demargne: Um so, I'll I'll I'll check.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I mean the first thing I need to check is obviously uh creating a new user.
 
 
01:13:49
 
Fred Demargne: So uh I think I need the admin as well as a test environment
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: which I'm missing from your
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah,
Fred Demargne: email.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the CEO for now right when you go to I will go. Can you see my screen? The creation and invitation is done in the CEO right now.
Fred Demargne: your screen. One
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,
Fred Demargne: second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: if you remember, we talked about it. I think the arrangers have to have the feature, right?
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see my screen?
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I can see your screen. Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. If you remember, we talked about having uh users, right? instead of having introducers and everything uh like this introducer arrangers right. So when I go to users right now I have all of the users uh I have the investors and the other types of users and I can go here select the type I want say partners I have these types of partners you can see um the email I shared with you and here you can go and add account right and you can select okay which say you want to create an investor you We put the
 
 
01:15:19
 
Fred Demargne: You are in a CEO now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry,
Fred Demargne: You are in a CEO uh access. No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't I don't I don't hear you.
Fred Demargne: you connected as a CEO. Okay, let me because I think I don't know you're going a bit too fast for me as I'm trying to I don't know
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: the navigation yet. So, let me connect at the same time on my on my um on the page as a CEO. I can follow exactly the steps that you mentioned. I don't have to bother you. So uh you were going first to what uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: section users on the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Users.
Fred Demargne: left?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. The sidebar, right?
Fred Demargne: So me I've got dashboard messages approvals deals vehicles investors subscription request document versus sign introducer aranger users.
Ghiles Moussaoui: users. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: And here uh you can see all status there is a button
Fred Demargne: I have add
Ghiles Moussaoui: to Yeah.
 
 
01:16:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And Yeah.
Fred Demargne: account.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So other account you would create the account that you want and you could invite the person and you could see the details of the
Fred Demargne: So where do you see all users?
Ghiles Moussaoui: page.
Fred Demargne: by one one thing there is a I think you mentioned there was a filter to filter all users by um persona type
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, you could uh you can see the search bar search by name, email or country. there is all types.
Fred Demargne: yes okay
Ghiles Moussaoui: The button next to it is called all types. When you click on it, it opens the the dropdown.
Fred Demargne: perfect that's clear to me here perfect uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: and those ones are all test for the moment
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So for now everything everything is also test and you can see
Fred Demargne: So one one uh one small question for you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: a table.
Fred Demargne: Um when we launch
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Mhm.
Fred Demargne: um obviously we're going to have the production environment.
 
 
01:17:37
 
Fred Demargne: Uh if I understood well you told me that there's at the moment there's only one environment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So, we're going to need on January 10th, we're going to need to have so the current testing environment to be uh used as a production environment and and to create another environment for testing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, no problem.
Fred Demargne: No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um when I was working on the plan I was using the testing environment and when it told me this I wanted to start testing I um changed it to this right the verso uh the
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: URL so we can go test directly in one environment and not make it complicated but yeah I think um so what you would identify it as a testing environment
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the domain will be changed because we would use verse.com for the main and we could use something else uh you know currently just uh do
Fred Demargne: Okay, that's clear. That's perfect. We just need to make sure that it's clear to me because based on the testing,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:18:36
 
Fred Demargne: maybe some of the feature will not work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: And as you can see,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Of course.
Fred Demargne: Julian wants to launch anyway.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I
Fred Demargne: Uh so we need to create the branch properly so that we know what will be deployed
Ghiles Moussaoui: think
Fred Demargne: in in the verso tech envir domain and what will not be.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think that's just a side
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: comment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I think um we need testing checklist from the most important process feature for the most important persona,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right?
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And we can um you know move forward like that and see what how much ground we can cover up until 10th of January so we can launch right. there will be always things that we have to do um after the launch because we
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: will invest I mean invite multiple users and yeah so that's what I'm thinking
Fred Demargne: Um so now it's working.
Ghiles Moussaoui: about
 
 
01:19:33
 
Fred Demargne: Uh so the admin uh in testing environment when when do you think you will be able to share with
Ghiles Moussaoui: um so the admin is mostly the features because I was testing myself mostly
Fred Demargne: me?
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's inside the CEO right now right so for example in inviting users um and also seeing compliance and the processes remember you told me okay we need to remove it from here it's
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: not much work so I can just take it into the the other portal I didn't do it because it takes
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: more time uh on my side for testing uh so yeah I can do it and in the user stories there isn't much about the admin right it's written SAS um and uh you
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: know
Fred Demargne: it's uh remind me how did you do the all the content management?
Ghiles Moussaoui: the sorry what account
Fred Demargne: the content the content management you know what we discussed it was supposed to be
Ghiles Moussaoui: management
Fred Demargne: in it's in the CEO or it's in the admin so all the data room all to create the
 
 
01:20:42
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: content management
Fred Demargne: data room documents uh the templates
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah. So yeah.
Fred Demargne: It's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um for vehicles or series it's here. For investment opportunities it's deals. For subscriptions it's here. For documents is here.
Fred Demargne: But when you need to when you need to upload documents,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: is it from the CEO or from the admin?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, it's for the CEO right now because I I put everything in one place for like specific features.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: For example, the uh data rooms for a specific investment opportunity. When you go in, you have uh directly the overview. If you remember, we have this progress.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: how many per people or investors we have at each stage. And when you go to term sheet, you can upload the document, right? Upload attachment here and you upload the term sheet. And similarly with documents and data rooms, right? So you could upload file or via link or document grant access and document as well and members.
 
 
01:22:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. No, makes sense.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, if you you can focus now until Monday. We can focus on what we have and then we will see on Monday uh how we work on the admin. Um um did you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: create this notion page that we me we discussed before Christmas uh with all the user story to know what you've done and what is still
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh,
Fred Demargne: missing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's not a notion for me. I've been working with Obsidian. Uh you can see my screen, but I can put it in
Fred Demargne: I mean it's if it's similar to notion with a an easy way to track what's done what is done to
Ghiles Moussaoui: notion.
Fred Demargne: add act to add we need to have a way of working the two of us so that it's you know it's easy to add action to plan things to do etc
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: etc
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I will I will create it in ocean if you because I think this is um one person access it's local also for the data.
 
 
01:23:10
 
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So okay I will create an oceanion database and I will share it with you.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's not done
Fred Demargne: If you prefer another tool, it doesn't matter to me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yet.
Fred Demargne: It's just a way to be able to plan to play with the canban. It's quite convenient. And I think we need to have we need to have two canband.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: We need to have one for the testing and one for the production because
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh
Fred Demargne: here there will be action that Julian we just discussed with Julian that we need so some action which is not on your side which will be on Tom for the website some action which will be on us
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh but some specific action that we need to do you know um to create the domain is created but then we need to have an account on superbase we need to create accounts in different tools that the production environment will work well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I think we need to have two can.
 
 
01:24:03
 
Fred Demargne: Um and I see on the on the on the GitHub that you you were man you managed to upload all the user stories that I share with you to the to to a table. Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: So in GitHub repositories there's object. Yeah, I I could create uh like the access you gave me for the user stories was view only. So I scraped it and I have the this user stories. If you see my screen in GitHub, I have this user stories six and no this is compliance user stories
Fred Demargne: called the user story mobile V6
Ghiles Moussaoui: from yeah uh this is
Fred Demargne: audit.
Ghiles Moussaoui: CSV I don't know if it is possible to read. What you can do is navigate uh yeah you could navigate
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to versa portal verse portal and then you can go to um verso no not source. Yeah. Source then docs. Where is docs? Docs. Docs. Yeah. Docs work.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, it's here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
 
 
01:25:29
 
Fred Demargne: I mean the user mobile story V6. Yeah. What
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it
Ghiles Moussaoui: What I did is I extracted um I extracted all of user stories.
Fred Demargne: way do I see what is done and what is not done basically?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh okay. So here in verso obsidian I created a couple of documents working with so the audit and then the meeting not the meeting the audit and what works for now when you go to uh what is I didn't share it yet but here I've been creating this in the morning I created this 10 days arrangers persona status report co persona status report and phase two status report that we created where you can go and check what has been done mostly it's been done customer report builder I think yeah these things are not done but 95% done um so similarly so I will create document I will share you I will share it with you either in ocean or in github as as you want.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think notion makes sense if you prefer to work with notion, you have experience with it.
 
 
01:26:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh
Fred Demargne: Uh I mean for the status it's up to you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: um it's just for me to know whether it makes sense to to make some testing or not because if if I know things haven't been developed and deployed then there is no
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: need for me to to test it you know u so it doesn't have to be notion you just need to explain I basically before I start testing I just need to have a clear view of what is available what is not so a list of developers that you made with the status um because you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: will clearly impact the planning of the testing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Um I think from your Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So it doesn't have to be notion if you see what I mean.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I just need to have a simple way to to have access to this information linking it to the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would break it down.
Fred Demargne: user
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:27:48
 
Fred Demargne: story.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I would break it down per user story, per page, per persona documents and I would share I would share everything with you. I think um you should from your side I think it's very helpful if you focus on the processes right especially when there is multi-stage process that we have to uh make sure it works
Fred Demargne: there that would be my focus.
Ghiles Moussaoui: because
Fred Demargne: So I will start by creation of a of an account. You know I will start from the very beginning. Uh ju just one thing which I mention which I realized because I think at
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: at some point we're going to need to to to divide the the bugs between uh the the functionality and and for design we will need to differentiate the
Ghiles Moussaoui: The sorry.
Fred Demargne: bugs which are functionality bugs and design bugs. I suppose you know for instance if I go as a CEO if I if I go on the CEO of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, you mean you mean back end?
Fred Demargne: deals and I open one deal and if I look at the at the
 
 
01:28:57
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: um you've you've created this uh progress status uh which we discussed with dispatch view interested NDA the design of it is not good because the line is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: crossing over the the rounds
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah. I get it. I get it. And there is design issues uh for sure. For example, the light mode and dark mode. If you remember, you told me, let's focus on the blue uh white to make it easier for me to cover more ground faster for the phase. I I just made it um possible for both. But before when I created the staff portal, it was hardcoded as dark. So, it's harder to switch directly. For example, when I go to dashboard, I switch to light mode.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can see these elements are, you know, still dark. So, I can fix it, but it just takes time. So, if I focus on the back end, right, where you have all the APIs or the functionalities that work,
 
 
01:30:04
 
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the database, and then the UI is, I think, easier and to build because
Fred Demargne: I agree. I agree. is just me when I'm running the test.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I need to be able to identify all the bugs.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh and some of them will be more prioritized than others. So we need to define uh a terminology.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So that's what I first of all is where do I create the bugs? I I'm thinking that notion is a good place to do it because we can share actions back and forth and and and I can put in a pipeline and then whenever you you you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Mhm.
Fred Demargne: you deal with it then you move it to you know done or to-do or you know so there needs to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: be uh different categories and I will put and I need for each bugs I will create to be able to define if it's uh back end is it front end uh and and then the level of
 
 
01:31:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Yeah, makes sense. The database for that.
Fred Demargne: criticality.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I don't know if you would like to work with AI to I guess you will have you would need many um understand much more understanding right the platform is complex and you would like to understand how it's built um I don't know if you have time to go through to do meetings uh on a daily basis before the launch once you're
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I think we should we should do daily meetings.
Ghiles Moussaoui: testing.
Fred Demargne: Um I think I think uh obviously I I caught up too late in the process to be able to fully understand everything you've done because if I try to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: understand everything it will not
Ghiles Moussaoui: So that's why Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So that's why I'm I'm telling uh there is maybe an agent Claude AI uh Claude for example. If you go, it can connect you to an account and connect it to the GitHub and you would be able to ask questions about anything in the code and database, I
 
 
01:32:16
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: believe.
Fred Demargne: that would be nice if you if you can tell me how to do
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um, okay. I I think I have to share my account with you. Um, I will try and see if I can invite you more.
Fred Demargne: So for for the development um because I already had an an account um I have an account on GitHub but under the another email address not the virtual
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: holdings but the concluder.com so it's f
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: it's the same f it's just at
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: concluder.com instead of atversalings.com
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So if you can uh if you can give me all the access and to uh give
Ghiles Moussaoui: And
Fred Demargne: me access to an agent so that I can ask questions that would be
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay, I will try to get you access to cloud.
Fred Demargne: amazing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that makes sense. And all right, so another thing.
 
 
01:33:27
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. What I need to do now is to understand should I be focusing on the user stories as much as have been um I mean I have been focusing on that because the platform was built mostly into portals right now. So I just go to the user stories and try to make sense of it and digitalize it for each persona. Right.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh should I be should I just finish the work like like that?
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It takes me about one day per persona to go into each page, implement it if it's not yet, see issues, fix the issues, make sure the Y works and everything. But it's still not uh you know time I did
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: not take the time or in a day don't have the same time to go into the deep processes, right? I go persona per persona which means um I rely on uh thinking that okay the other persona works because for example arrangers has persona has a lot of work to do with introducer and partners right and yeah so I go persona persona
 
 
01:34:38
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah, of course. I mean, look. Uh,
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah gh I
Fred Demargne: do you say or
Ghiles Moussaoui: think it's French and she
Fred Demargne: Okay. uh the uh I mean for me you what what you need
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: to because if we all do the same thing then we will never manage to in one week to be ready. So I think you need to run the unitary test. So make sure as you just said for each story that there is that you can check that it's implemented yes or no it works yes or no.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I also do it. uh I do both an automatic way and um manual way. So I simulate the browser,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I give it the login credentials, it goes to Chrome, it does everything and it goes to page per page to check and test through the operations uh the database and all.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So that that's perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: That's perfect.
 
 
01:35:34
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: And then my job and I need to coordinate with Ashish and maybe more people and J maybe will need to test is to do the UAT.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So the user acceptance test and most of it needs to be done
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I agree.
Fred Demargne: manually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Especially for investor to make sure that um because it's the the bigger user budget we have as well and the experience matters more there I believe um
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: as they are customers.
Fred Demargne: Exactly. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Fred Demargne: so what I need what I need what I need from you um is I need to know what we discussed before about what has been done, what is still to be done. I need to know for each user story whether you passed the what I call the unitary test or whether you have not yet because otherwise we're going to cross each other and I'm going
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: to raise bugs on things which you haven't tested yet which will be a waste of time because you will need to
 
 
01:36:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: review the bugs and you should not have spent time to review a bug for something you haven't tested
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: yet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I will make sure to uh share with you everything by today evening. So the the notion the documents for what is built and
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the uh so where I am at what I'm doing what I have tested what I haven't tested and I think we can do meetings on a daily basis especially if you are able to you know test and report back to me quickly so we can change as well um
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: daily basis so I'm working right now on
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: um I mean
Fred Demargne: do you prefer mornings or afternoons based on the workload?
Ghiles Moussaoui: from morning to evening you can do. I'm flexible uh currently.
Fred Demargne: Okay, let me see my agenda for next week.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah.
Fred Demargne: and um and see what is the best timing uh so that I can because I've got
 
 
01:37:25
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Mhm.
Fred Demargne: some meetings planned so I need to see if I can change them but uh yeah I'll I'll tell you so we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: do um I think we have to uh do a daily meeting maybe we need to have a catch up at the end of the day uh just a quick one just to see if there's things which are not clear not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: to review everything but just to review you know if you have comments questions I have
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: comments questions that we we block a time in our agenda to to review
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for
Fred Demargne: Um and then um what else?
Ghiles Moussaoui: sure.
Fred Demargne: I think if you could today if you could start building the two cans, one for production, one for testing. Uh so that we we are clear,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: we we start putting everything that we have to to think about for the launch. I think for until until Monday,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think you should I mean we should have this canban and I can add it add more stuff into it over the weekend but I think for the moment we need to focus on testing on the
 
 
01:38:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: platform and then on Monday we'll
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And um yeah and document is a big thing as well as I think of
Fred Demargne: see
Ghiles Moussaoui: it. The docu because so Julian told me I think he worked with uh another company to generate the NDA workflow for example but he they did not share the workflow with him. So um when I was talking when we created it for example I just said okay let me just create a
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: draft template to move forward create it test it make sure it works and then we can later on either you get me the workflow template that has been created from that company or I I make it better right so I never had the chance to make it better um we have to check for example the design and and all maybe the watermarking of the documents
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but this will that will be part of my test. Don't worry. Uh I think this other company to be honest, I don't think they did a very good job.
 
 
01:39:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Uh so I'm not so sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: For the NDA.
Fred Demargne: Huh.
Ghiles Moussaoui: For the NDA, you
Fred Demargne: Yeah, because for the idea they didn't work on the template.
Ghiles Moussaoui: mean?
Fred Demargne: What they did is uh Junian was trying to find a company that could help us to automate uh tasks and the NDA was one of the first one but to be honest
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it was not done very well and it took forever. So so what this this company has done is to is a way to automate from emails the sending of an NDA.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I don't think it's going to be very relevant for you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Is
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, I think uh I mean the goal was to put everything inside.
Fred Demargne: it
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if you see my screen uh I create everything in n when it comes to automations because programmatic and you can have everything uh here right and yeah so the HTML is created here for the template so the thing is what they created they own it they did not share it uh with you which means you don't have access to the workflow the code that generates the automation
 
 
01:40:36
 
Fred Demargne: No, I think uh I think we have access to it. We need to check.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I don't know what um but I'm not so sure it's relevant for for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. It's not uh what I the go what I my point was basically okay I did it
Fred Demargne: you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: quick for the NDA right it took me a few hours um to generate the template from the examples. So that has to be uh you know you have to take a look into it especially as well the we have to define where the um signing is uh put right the signature because it's signed outside and then it's put in there right it's printed on the document.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. No, but this this will be part of my testing,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: you know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.
Fred Demargne: when I do a process and I will generate a document and I will see whether it's working fine including the signature and then if I if I see there's something to be fixed and we will fix
 
 
01:41:31
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it. I think that's the best approach isn't
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. I think it's obviously the best approach.
Fred Demargne: it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um the one document I didn't work on currently is the certificate. I think it's um simple.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, there's a there's a template.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So, that's relatively straightforward.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Can you share with me the template for it or should I create it
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Now,
Ghiles Moussaoui: from?
Fred Demargne: I can I can send you a word
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. So,
Fred Demargne: template.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can automate it. Yeah. And uh if you could specify in there what parameters change. I mean it's obvious. I saw some examples. They are easy but uh in case. So yeah. Hello.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. What did you say?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, is there any other points we should go through?
Fred Demargne: No, no, no. I think that's it. and and the canvas from production.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: The idea is to reinitiate the canvan and I will add more more items and then we can start planning it next week. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Good luck. Bye bye.
