### 00:00:00

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.  
Fred Demargne: Hey, how are you?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Good. Good. What about  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I'm good. Let me adjust my  
Ghiles Moussaoui: you?  
Fred Demargne: sound. Here we go. Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Nice.  
Fred Demargne: Can you hear me? Well,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh,  
Fred Demargne: yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yes, I can hear you.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Okay. Good. Um, so let's start. Uh, I've started to build a canban on your notion page because that's for me what's one of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: the main points. Um, obviously yours under engineering needs to be edited. Oh, there was some uh I'm going to delete use a template and some of the stuff were  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: already filled in. So, I'm deleting  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So I created uh that mostly like a template uh to be  
Fred Demargne: it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: edited. I focus more on the verse processes page right to I don't know if you have access to it at the end there's a page called business processes.  
   
 

### 00:03:03

   
Fred Demargne: So business processes let me see because I was checking the pre the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you see?  
Fred Demargne: other page and then it told me that nothing was ready for UAT. So I was a bit surprised. Um I mean I didn't know what to understand  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: from  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah.  
Fred Demargne: this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I want to base basically um the other so tables, right? the canvas production testing and uh user stories. I think user stories um I don't think it's uh ideal. So what I've done for the verse process is I grouped the user stories into multiple processes right the first one is like um uh series creation deal creation dispatching to the specific personas and then for each persona there is a workflow for example investor you know interest tracking uh having their progress um either send NDA to access data room and then subscribe or subscribe and receive an NDA subs and the subscription ction pack and with the introducer and and um the other processes, right? So, we group them together into a multi-stage process and I think it's better um to test that.  
   
 

### 00:04:30

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um what do you think?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I agree that.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know if you saw the  
Fred Demargne: So I mean I need to start from the very beginning for me to test the uh the creation of user. But yes, this is at the moment the focus. But when I click on versat process, it's empty.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Really? Wait. Um Can you check again? There is another file.  
Fred Demargne: Let me check.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Just enter the vers processes. It's  
Fred Demargne: So if I go to verso tech first and then click at the end uh Verso business  
Ghiles Moussaoui: called  
Fred Demargne: process  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: map.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you check it up?  
Fred Demargne: I don't have access. Yeah. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh can you see it?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it works.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um this basically outlines all of the processes and when you scroll down um it's broken down by persona.  
   
 

### 00:06:01

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, and they get navigation for each persona. And then when you get to, yeah, when you get to four, the section four, core business process, get the investment life cycle, uh, you start seeing basically how um, I use all of the user stories to create this. And so there is the phases. Phase one uh deal setup and then opportunity dispatch interest and NDA and phase four subscription funding uh certificate issuance fee payments and then there is cross persona interaction matrix who interacts with what uh who interacts with who notification map um and the workflows by phase uh subscription pack life cycle reconciliation ations fee and commission structure. Um,  
Fred Demargne: But I think what is um what is very important is to is to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and  
Fred Demargne: document the way the the platform works.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yes,  
Fred Demargne: I mean it's great for you to make sure that there is a match between what you understood from the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: so  
Fred Demargne: requirements uh and what you are developing or have been developing but I  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
   
 

### 00:07:24

   
Fred Demargne: think here uh I think given the time frame  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: that we have the most important thing is to document the way it's been implemented  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. So how who's going to use it the first day and how is it be going to be used like um who so first we will send it to all of the so we will invite investors the personas that we have right I think grouping them first like having them as data that we  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: can send directly because we'll have to create their accounts and add their email to invite Right. And this takes probably time because um I don't know what in what database you have them in the CRM or do you have a spreadsheet for all of them?  
Fred Demargne: What do you mean? We have a spreadsheet for all of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So from the meeting I um I understood that we have about thousand  
Fred Demargne: them.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: investors uh 20 to 100 introducers and all of that right. How do we invite them?  
   
 

### 00:08:35

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think we shouldn't invite them one by one.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's bulk invite and so we'll create the accounts that are missing as well. Um we don't  
Fred Demargne: I think we should invite them. Um, I think we're going to invite them vehicles by vehicles because we need to make sure  
Ghiles Moussaoui: have  
Fred Demargne: that whenever before we invite them, we need I need to make sure that everything in production is ready. So I think um the process should go one by one per vehicles looking at the uh investors and the associated partners,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: commercial partners etc etc. introducers and then based on that uh we invite them so that we make sure that when they will connect the first time everything related to them is uh is is all working  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is correct. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: fine.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, I don't know if the dashboard Excel uh document has everything.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um Julian shared it with me before. I try to add the subscriptions, the investments, the um the investors in there, right?  
   
 

### 00:09:52

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh but I'm not sure if it is correct. For example, some of them are different, right? So, I had to approximate. Um some tables are different from others. Uh some have negative numbers.  
Fred Demargne: What do you mean?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: H uh VC01 for  
Fred Demargne: What do you mean certain are different from others?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: example the structure is different from uh the other VC documents.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The  
Fred Demargne: it's um but VC1 is only I mean VC1 is been closed and  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: um so it's not important but yes it was different because it was a different type of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: deal. Um I mean the one thing that we have to do and I don't know  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: why there are sheets created empty sheets now I think this document online it shouldn't be edited uh because now I see things which should not happen it's weird  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, there is also negative numbers. I think it was paid um like you pay someone with um maybe stock or shares as Julian explained to me and they couldn't do anything with the escro account at that time.  
   
 

### 00:11:09

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I did not have the lawyers uh persona. Uh so yeah I I'm asking if the dashboard will be the main as a source of truth for migrating data to the to the  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: platform.  
Fred Demargne: The bird the dashboard is a single uh view of truth. Yes. Uh the one thing that Julian told you is and I was here on the call when he repeated it to you and  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: and because I recommended it is to avoid um using the investors which invested through an Julian should have told  
Ghiles Moussaoui: True.  
Fred Demargne: you uh how to understand that from the dashboard but some investors invested through their banks.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: And this um we are in a process of updating this and changing this. So we are not ready to include this for day one. So you need to exclude uh all investment made through ISIN.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: uh apart from this yes everything is is a basis for our audit of the accounts. So that's the single um single uh data that we use internally to make sure that everything is linked.  
   
 

### 00:12:43

   
Fred Demargne: So you have the investors, you have the amounts, you have the the introducers, the partners, you have everything.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So wait there is partners uh in the dashboard and  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: introducers um on the same Do you  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: see sheets specifically?  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. I didn't see that last time. Maybe I didn't understand it.  
Fred Demargne: So everything is linked. Um so anyway let's not go into those details. Me I'd like to have first an overview uh to have a proper daily where you know we understand where we are. Uh first of all so I created a canban in the page because for me that's the canban  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: board so we know what actions we are doing on our sides on  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: both sides. Um that's one thing. Uh so I'd like to understand so I mean I I I put two actions on my site that uh we discussed.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So which sorry which Kenban uh is that that you have  
   
 

### 00:14:04

   
Fred Demargne: One was so it's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: added?  
Fred Demargne: a board. It's a canban board. So if you go to the notion uh and the team spaces you the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: team you created there is underneath a canban board. Can you see  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, no.  
Fred Demargne: it?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Maybe it wasn't shared with me or it's in your  
Fred Demargne: Let me share my Let me share my  
Ghiles Moussaoui: private. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: screen. Can you view  
Ghiles Moussaoui: moment.  
Fred Demargne: this?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, yep. Yes, I can.  
Fred Demargne: So I just you review the template. It's not a big deal. I'm just in a process of so for me in our daily we should review we I mean each of us should re should put their um information in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: True.  
Fred Demargne: there uh of what is doing so that we know and we can create tasks you know and and review where we are uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: obviously for me the main thing will be the testing uh which I need to start  
   
 

### 00:15:40

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: once I it's clear for me what I can do now after this meeting. And then the reviewing is if you have questions for me uh based on bugs or  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: stuff that I think uh I would be reviewing this and when the action are done and we move it to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. So, not started yet.  
Fred Demargne: done.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um is what needs to be done in development what I'm working on testing is uh me and you I suppose or okay so the testing the reviewing questions and all right yeah  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: that works for me yeah So,  
Fred Demargne: Um, so I need maybe to get design thing because it was in the template and I don't think we need  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: this at the moment. But I don't know. I can I need to check if I can move it uh to the bottom.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: He doesn't put it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you check Can you check if you invited me? I think I don't have access to this.  
   
 

### 00:16:45

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can board.  
Fred Demargne: else.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I didn't have it. I didn't see it. Uh, launch production. Yeah, all I see is ones that I have created. Maybe it was stored in your um  
Fred Demargne: No, I normally I put I specifically share with you when I created it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: private.  
Fred Demargne: I just share it shared it again. So, let me know if it works.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, so this is outside the verse tech document.  
Fred Demargne: It's in the team spaces.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Now I see it. I was confused, but I see it. Oh, good. But I see to-do in progress and complete. It's different thing.  
Fred Demargne: because you need to look at the detail  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh. Oh.  
Fred Demargne: board.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Yeah. I will fill it with informations for not started and in development and for the testing I think. Okay. So what I've tested so far I told you I'm going persona by persona.  
   
 

### 00:18:13

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I still have some to do in CP commercial partners to test the proxy investment and the pages and I started uh from the the document I showed you. I started testing uh workflow by workflow automatically and also manually. So I started by testing the authentification.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So creation of each um persona account type right and inviting them.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so before if you remember um if you remember the invite link I was sending it was sent in from superbase uh o right? I had to change that yesterday. Uh this is why I didn't have time to edit the notion. Can you see my screen?  
Fred Demargne: Let me see. Yeah, I don't see yet. Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: now I see him.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So here um now I get an invite link like this. So it is sent by um either onboarding resend.dev. It has to be sent from no reply at send dot something like versoldings.com or versat.com. So the reason it is sending from here is I had to cut the um yeah so like this sending from onboarding um that because I had to um I think wait I can show you better example.  
   
 

### 00:20:00

   
Fred Demargne: Can we have a a document uh wherever is easier for you where we list all those um email addresses that will be used? because I think we need to clean this to have something as as not not too many addresses and probably know I know he hasn't shared with  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think  
Fred Demargne: me the document but I remember when I was in Dubai he prepared it he's got this idea of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: avatar and agent and maybe he would want those email to be sent from their email  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um yeah so it depends if there is email interaction right for example this is  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: about the inviting when you invite somebody they receive an email like this to access a  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: platform and this um message which was written by uh  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Julia and so this welcome to Verso holdings a testing investor entity so this is just the name of the entity I was testing But it's sending from my domain. I do not have domain.  
   
 

### 00:21:05

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I have to set up the um one. Okay. Resend  
Fred Demargne: has Julian put a document when he sent you the email content.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the email content. No, I don't have the email content.  
Fred Demargne: Yes. the one you just said that Julian uh uh confirmed to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: oh, he just sent me the template, the text in WhatsApp, this text and the logo. He told me make it U League Spartan  
Fred Demargne: WhatsApp.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: font.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. But I think we need to start documenting things properly because WhatsApp is not a great way to even for you for us to test Uh what do you suggest?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I think.  
Fred Demargne: Um I think we should have a single document whether it's online or  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: doesn't matter where we have all the email addresses that would be used and then for each of the key processes  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: where an email is sent we need to have the content being defined.  
   
 

### 00:22:14

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yeah. So there is um I don't know if there is much email sending in the platform. There is this invite. There is the reset password invite. Um but the rest I think is in marketing. I'm not sure.  
Fred Demargne: Now we have uh when there is a subscription pack,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: we need to send the subscription pack with an email.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So it's for now it's like notification and you you have it inside the platform. It's not via email yet. I mean, there is email notification, but it's until yesterday that I uh set up the resend.com, but I did it with my uh So, if I go to domains, I did it with my domain. So, we have to change this. We have to It's easier. You just have to create a new domain. Uh delete this. Create new domain. And um the domain owner I will give him the DNS records and they just have to put them inside um where they bought the the domain and then it's set up.  
   
 

### 00:23:25

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can send through a branded email uh because um it would be more trustworthy and yeah the rest is easy. You can use the same service to send emails.  
Fred Demargne: Mhm.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, and it doesn't matter because I can just use no reply at send plus holdings or like persec.com and they I would  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: use  
Fred Demargne: I don't think um I don't know if he specifically asked you to put Verso holdings,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: No,  
Fred Demargne: but I think I think we will not mention Verso holdings.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: he didn't.  
Fred Demargne: We will mention  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um, I don't know the domain that exists you want to use.  
Fred Demargne: Verso.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't have any problem with it. Um.  
Fred Demargne: The domain is Verso Tech I believe.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. So I know  
Fred Demargne: So those emails should be sent from the domain Verso Tech.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: that.  
Fred Demargne: The Verso Tech domain already exists. Let me see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh do I have the I'm not sure if I have the uh credentials.  
   
 

### 00:24:30

   
Fred Demargne: Let me see. Um, let me see. Because Gian has his habits to send me important message on WhatsApp and then it's very complicated to track it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Most communication was done in  
Fred Demargne: Let me see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: WhatsApp.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, it's not the best way to um for for to keep information like this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Let me see if he sent me by email because I think at some point I had the um I had the credentials but I don't know if where they  
Ghiles Moussaoui: domain.  
Fred Demargne: are. Uh yeah, I don't find them. Uh let me see if it's not in the drive and I can open the uh account.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What credential you for? Uh which credentials are you looking  
Fred Demargne: Sorry.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for?  
Fred Demargne: Um for the uh to go to the domains to see the domains that we have and the verso tech and then you can maybe  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I can already do the um the setting that you can then  
   
 

### 00:25:57

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: whenever you are ready everything is already in in place you know. Uh one second one second. So, don't go there. Let me see if this works. up. Up. Okay. This a problem. Maybe you change your password. There's um there's a validation where you must have received an uh an email with a code. Let me ask him. So, um, so let's wait for him to say it to me. So here the action to do just to be clear is uh I'm just going to write it down so that if it's not if it doesn't get back to me I will do it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: Um so tell me exactly what I need to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: do.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: so once you're ready, you can send me an email and I have to just go here. Uh, create a new domain. It will be so to be clear I will not send emails from versitech.com I will send it through a subdomain either senders.com or mail.veritech.com com.  
   
 

### 00:28:37

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: The reason for that is in case emails land inside spam folder, you don't risk the reputation of the domain to be blacklisted. And so when you use it as an official domain of the platform, uh it stays uh always with good reputation, right? So I will add a domain here as I did with this one. I will call it this mailb.com and they will give me DNS records. And when you go to let's say the platform is um GoDaddy I believe uh where you put the domains is the platform or namecheep yeah and they will give you uh the DNS records they give me usually it's four and you just  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: go to DNS um add the new DNS record and you do that four times and then once you're done um this will be verified and that's it.  
Fred Demargne: So, can you tell me exactly? So, I put or you put it If you want, you can uh edit everything you need for me in the canban board. I just created um uh a tasks for  
   
 

### 00:29:40

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: me which is called verse tech email  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is that?  
Fred Demargne: setup. You see uh in in development operations you have verse tech email  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: setup. Yeah it's there.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: apartments.  
Fred Demargne: It's under operation your view in your screen. Uh you have operation and then you have three actions three tasks.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh  
Fred Demargne: The first one is verse tech email setup.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So if you edit it in comments and you mention specifically what I need to do,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So this is the  
Fred Demargne: what what what you need from me so that I will work on it because Julian is not getting back  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: to me yet. So if you put here all the things that you need from me then I will  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: work on it and I will move it to done when it's done and you can open it and then you will get all the information you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: got it. Um,  
   
 

### 00:30:53

   
Fred Demargne: need.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: so okay, the state for now I cannot change the domain because if I change it we will not be able to test the invitation link because it sends it from this domain. So I  
Fred Demargne: No, I agree.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: need  
Fred Demargne: I agree. I agree. I agree. You may not need to to make the change now. It's just that we need to capture all the actions in detail so that everything is documented.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand.  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I'm not suggesting that you change it. It's just you know as as we discuss in the daily the actions and we have them capture  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: in his board and then um and then we uh whoever needs to take the lead will take the lead and I will and get it done. So then when you look for it when it's time then you will see under these tasks all the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: information you need whenever it's relevant for you to do it.  
   
 

### 00:31:48

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I understand. Um, Fred. Fred. Is there a way to put assign? Okay. Assign to Fred. Okay. Okay. So, when you create Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: from  
Ghiles Moussaoui: When you create uh for me, you can just assign it to me.  
Fred Demargne: here  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And yeah so that that is simple um operations engineering is there other stuff testing is alone  
Fred Demargne: for the moment. I mean, for the moment there's only this um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay so what I need  
Fred Demargne: I just wanted to simplify it just between you and me. Um, and then maybe I will discuss with Julian if Julian wants to get  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: a specific category for him. The idea is to avoid uh WhatsApp communication to to have everything documented for the actions and then I think we should add a page I don't know if it's notion or in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand.  
Fred Demargne: GitHub with all the emails.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: So there is not many but the email content uh and the email addresses that we're going to use.  
   
 

### 00:33:01

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah, documentation.  
Fred Demargne: It's a yeah it's a documentation. I don't know if you want to put it in notion or if you prefer to put it in GitHub. For me that's not a big deal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: The important thing is that we have this documentation ready. So that we are able to refer to it whenever we  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, I think Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: need.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's better you tell me where you would rather have it. For me, I can have it everywhere. Um, it doesn't matter because it's  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Uh let me let me see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: simple.  
Fred Demargne: I mean usually me I was using uh Jira for this kind of things but we're not using  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Jira.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Internally, I use Obsen.  
Fred Demargne: Uh,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you see my screen,  
Fred Demargne: what do you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh, internally I use Obsidian. If you see my screen.  
Fred Demargne: use?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So in Obsidian it's easy because I can tell the agent directly through my terminal uh to create documents inside the without opening uh the editor.  
   
 

### 00:34:06

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: It creates documents and I have them here and so I have everything I work for.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't push every time everything to GitHub because it's just messy. Uh but this this is mostly technical. So I keep everything here and it's easier for me to generate documentation uh meetings as well. I store them here and so I can push all of these documents to notion  
Fred Demargne: Let's let's continue.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: H uh  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, let's continue to use obsidian. I don't have an issue with that. If it's easier for you,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah I think but Obsidian has uh I think you  
Fred Demargne: that's fine for me. Um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: have to pay to have a synchronized account. That is an issue. Yeah. Uh so yeah,  
Fred Demargne: ah  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will push it to either GitHub or notion. Um however you like it and you just tell me the type of documentation you like and I will extract everything. So the email templates uh the emails that are being used for each email template and maybe process documentation as well for each process if it's like that.  
   
 

### 00:35:14

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I sorted this the one in notion. I will use this for testing.  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Obsidian is obsidian MD, right?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: H Yes. Yes. Yes.  
Fred Demargne: I cannot hear you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is uh  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I see that we have to pay $4 per user per month to sync it. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Um Okay, let me have a look.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I think you should keep on using Obsidian for the reason you mentioned.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I think I have  
Fred Demargne: The only question is yeah for if there is a way to automate the export to a tool which is free where we can actually um uh yeah work  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I do have an MCPT notion.  
Fred Demargne: together  
Ghiles Moussaoui: If so, let me just check. If it's the case, then we can just use notion so I can edit it automatically as well.  
Fred Demargne: do you pay to get uh do you pay to get this MCP  
   
 

### 00:36:31

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, for notion. No, it's a connector between uh agents and any other tool that has the ability  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: to  
Fred Demargne: between code and and notion.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Yes. Yeah, I'm using code and I'm doing stuff  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, I have I just need an API token.  
Fred Demargne: here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I have to remember where to get the API token. connectors. Yes. So, okay, notion works. I can use notion for that.  
Fred Demargne: So it's an is an extension to code or it's let me  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah,  
Fred Demargne: see  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I use cloud but um with agents here here. So you can see MCP if you see my screen I have a playright MCP which connects to the browser and simulates the work which means it simulates browser it can test uh everything automatically. It opens the browser and does tasks. notion MCP to um to write and do everything in notion as much as possible and um Superbase MCP to edit um and run migrations directly through the terminal instead of um doing everything through  
   
 

### 00:38:02

   
Fred Demargne: there.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: notion.  
Fred Demargne: But how do you connect? If I want to do it as well. How do you connect code to a notion  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh do you use cloud desktop or do you use terminal?  
Fred Demargne: desktop  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. So you have to go to let me just open my  
Fred Demargne: desktop?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: desktop. Um okay. And you go to settings um  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: connectors and you find  
Fred Demargne: It's a connector.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sorry  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I didn't know it was a connector. Let me try notion.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, you have to browse it.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think you can just write notion here if you don't have it. Um, yeah.  
Fred Demargne: And do you pay?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,  
Fred Demargne: Do you It say that I have to upgrade. I have a free version of clothes. Do you have to pay for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: oh, I don't know.  
Fred Demargne: it?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I pay the maximum version.  
   
 

### 00:38:59

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I work a lot with it. So, maybe it's because of that.  
Fred Demargne: But sorry the the connection was not good. I didn't hear everything you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah, I don't know. I think I use the maximum version.  
Fred Demargne: said  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know if you have to pay.  
Fred Demargne: because when I try to uh connect to notion it tells me it says upgrade to connect.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: And there's a connector URL which is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh  
Fred Demargne: mcp.notion.com and then  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: it's in miss invade access token. So it doesn't work.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I don't know what I need to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: do.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: so you have to upgrade, right?  
Fred Demargne: That's what it says to me. But to you you have a plan or not?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I do have a max pen. Yes.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay. So, you pay for it. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So, I need to check I need to check what I need to do then.  
   
 

### 00:40:02

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. uh if you want me I can find a way I don't think you can add members but they can share my credentials if you  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: want to work with um claude as well because in claude you can see here it has code this when you select um so you have to connect it to GitHub and you select the GitHub repo repo in case you select verse you can chat with verse tech so you can have access to um you know all the database you can ask questions. This is the agent I mentioned last time if you remember.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So that would be easy because I use a lot code for work. Um so then I can we can use it directly.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: But GitHub it seems like I can connect it without paying.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You try it.  
Fred Demargne: Uh huh.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I yeah but I I think you cannot index the database with the MCP to normal cloud. You have to use cloud code which is the one that you see in my screen.  
   
 

### 00:41:08

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: You have to switch from chat to code u because it this is a tool  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: made for engineering and so it indexes a database in the cloud and you can ask questions. Uh you can also make edits but uh yeah so you can understand everything if you'd like from the from the desktop app  
Fred Demargne: So this I need to if I need to do you say I must go to uh code code or I can also do it from the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: no I think for the database um code base it's from  
Fred Demargne: chat.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the uh code So I am still inside the desktop app.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know if you have um chat and code or you  
Fred Demargne: No, I don't.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: have  
Fred Demargne: But I I'm in setting because I never set up the code. So I am in setting. There is an option called code code.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: But I think here I need to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: pay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
   
 

### 00:42:08

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: So I need to check.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: I need to pay. I know. There is one for free.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, if you  
Fred Demargne: But the one for free, I'm not sure. No, to include closed code, I need to pay €15 per  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, if if you work with it a lot,  
Fred Demargne: month.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's good. You can invest in it. Uh, I will try to get you my account. I pay 200 a month. It's very good. I work a lot with it.  
Fred Demargne: We paid €200 per month.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: Wow.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's um, let me see. Oh, wait. Uh, great. Uh yeah, I pay to enter the month.  
Fred Demargne: So what do you have? You don't have only clothes. You have everything. Because max for me it says 90  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I have uh there is two max.  
Fred Demargne: month.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if I adjust plan if um okay there is one max five times this.  
   
 

### 00:43:11

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I go to adjust this, I can go, you can see here 5x or 20x, I get the 20x, but I believe I can gift Claude.  
Fred Demargne: Okay,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um Oh, okay. One month. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: you have to pay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: No.  
Fred Demargne: You have to pay I suppose.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah. Yeah, I can gift but uh I have to pay for it.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. this.  
Fred Demargne: It's already a gift.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, there was a feature I could gift before,  
Fred Demargne: Okay,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: but now um I have to pay for it, which is  
Fred Demargne: don't worry. I need to investigate.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: weird.  
Fred Demargne: Um I I'll investigate to see if there is a way. uh and if not I will pay for it because I think it's important that we um but basically what uh the only thing I need to do is um is to is to connect um so to connect notion but and then cl code is if I want to be able to connect with the code  
   
 

### 00:44:24

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: and ask questions directly.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So you can connect to uh GitHub for the code. You can connect to Superbase for uh the DB.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can ask questions directly to the database and you can connect to notion for automatically injecting data, deleting and editing uh everything there. And um yeah, you can analyze meetings and all of the other stuff with Excel and what you can do with cloud.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, know I use it a lot for many things but not for coding obviously. Uh but that's good. Yeah, it's good to know. Um so let me see. I think I can do I can connect with the GitHub easily.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: I just need to figure it out. Uh, and then for the rest I will need to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So if you can see uh I just told can you analyze a repo and code  
Fred Demargne: pay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and it told me uh a lot of things. So platform told me some metrics the architecture um some insight on that multi-persona um yeah database schema 92 tables this is um pretty old text tag and yeah a bunch of things but you can ask it more definitive questions and it can answer better and in case also later on you could also do edits.  
   
 

### 00:45:49

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can tell it to edit something from here. Uh and then it can test it. If it works, you can directly create a PR to either a testing environment or a production environment and it can Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Really?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So you can work on the cloud.  
Fred Demargne: Wow.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh you can make it directly without understanding much uh of the code.  
Fred Demargne: It's amazing.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: And can you can we prepare documentation using  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah.  
Fred Demargne: code?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can just tell it uh can you create documentation for all of this uh analyze you can prompt it well as well and it it will go analyze the code if you need specific documentation on a specific process uh and also how technical it is how yeah and then it will create the documentation in GitHub and it will create a PR it will push it to GitHub you can see it there or you can even uh you know get it uh inside notion directly So this is why I pay a lot for code.  
   
 

### 00:46:48

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I use it heavily.  
Fred Demargne: It's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And you can do um many other tricky things um like  
Fred Demargne: good.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: scraping uh for example if you remember you shared with me the the documents for uh requirements the user stories documents but it I couldn't download it so I had to scrape it with  
Fred Demargne: I thought I thought you had access to all our information uh with edit  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: mode. So I didn't know. Yeah, me for I I use code for scri for web scraping. I use a fire called MCP connect that uh it can web scrap I mean much more information into the into pages when I need to find  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah,  
Fred Demargne: information.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: there is a lot of AI tools. Cloud is my favorite for work. Uh but there is N8N for heavy automation use. uh as I created for also uh verso tech the uh workflows for reporting I don't know if you have to go through these or how do you prefer  
   
 

### 00:48:11

   
Fred Demargne: No,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: because  
Fred Demargne: I mean I I think for me the the point of this meeting is more to synchronize on the action that we need from each other.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: uh and then if we have specific questions maybe on specific things I think it's important to use this  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: opportunity but I'd rather focus really on things that we need to discuss because we need each  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: other uh and then uh and then if there are things that we didn't we  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: didn't think about and then we need to we need to we didn't discover discuss in a in a in a daily then we need to have a separate meeting. I'd rather have a session where we we cover um the the the point where we need each other, you know, uh that it's it's it's more efficient for all of us. Um I think for me,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: so there is one thing where you need for me it was for the for the email setup that we discussed.  
   
 

### 00:49:07

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So uh once you clarify everything you need from me then I will uh try to get the information for you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Um what else? What else do you need from me? I mean I I talked I saw the uh the templates so I'm I'm preparing them for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Let me Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So,  
Fred Demargne: What else do you need from me?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Superbase. Uh, I need to buy an account. So, it's a free version. I prefer to buy an account to have it has only 500 megabytes um that it can support without um you know a plan. So now it's free. I think it's better if we buy a plan for this billing.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Okay. Agree. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: subscription plans uh for production and and testing or just for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um it's the same.  
Fred Demargne: production.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think if we get the 25 a month, um it will cover everything.  
   
 

### 00:50:10

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: 100,000 monthly users. Um yeah, it's not heavy. So the 25 a month is I think all we need for Versal.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So if you if you so I created in a canban  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: board um a tasks where you are at the moment the uh um assigne uh and then once you once you've  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: you can list there all the uh the subscription plan that we  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Got it. Uh for now I I can only think of uh Versel. So let me go to Versal. It's deployed in Versal. I need to change the uh Yeah. Do you have access to Versel?  
Fred Demargne: would what do you mean? Uh no. Yeah, I think you gave me access to uh that's yeah ver no I don't have I have verse tech.lo love at versappro.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh the domain.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I don't have access to I'm not using versal uh like you you do.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:51:26

   
Fred Demargne: I just uh use a domain to get access and to start going through the application.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: If you think that we need to have we need to subscribe to versal and we need to do it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sorry. Subscribe to Versa. Uh, I have a subscription uh already paid.  
Fred Demargne: vessel.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I need to update the address here when I click on it. So I think it's Dubai of the Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: No, that would  
Ghiles Moussaoui: but it's billing address.  
Fred Demargne: be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I use the credit card um that Julian shared with me. It's for um I think yeah the Dubai uh credit card he shared with me. I don't know if it is personal, if it is a company credit card.  
Fred Demargne: It's personal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So, I don't know if you want to keep using that card.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I use it for many things.  
Fred Demargne: We I need to ask  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So this just annoying.  
Fred Demargne: him.  
   
 

### 00:52:28

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh we have to get it done billing address and domains. So you can see the domain is versat. It's just uh generated. I need like versat existing domain. Um, wait.  
Fred Demargne: Why does it says verso tech dash love  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's just a random generated domain because I did not set up a domain inside.  
Fred Demargne: at  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It was supposed to be versat.com, but uh Julia never shared with me the um either the domain or  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Yeah, you just send me the digit. Let me check. Ah, it's too late. I'm going to so I think if you if you put in the in um in notion can ban everything you need uh I mean all the subscription that you are considering  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: um then then we can keep track of it. You know what I mean?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. And okay. So this is one thing I keep track everything that I said in the meeting is registered. So I I will be able to edit.  
   
 

### 00:53:55

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem. So Wix access he shared with me Julian. I'm not sure who does the landing page. Landing page I did it in code. I don't know if I do it in um so this is a l  
Fred Demargne: Now we said the landing page should be done by uh by our designer. So it's um so this uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah  
Fred Demargne: let me add an action on  
Ghiles Moussaoui: because we have to integrate it after it is um created.  
Fred Demargne: this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I will either remove this and directly redirect to dash login with a button.  
Fred Demargne: So landing page. Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Production landing page.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Tom, right?  
Fred Demargne: Huh?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh it's called Tom.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. The guy is Tom. It's me too.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So there are two thing. One is that we need to work on it. name page design.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh I will put myself for the moment. And then there's uh the integration  
   
 

### 00:55:04

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: 752. Yes. So I have access to the GoDaddy account now.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay.  
Fred Demargne: code. Jian just sent me just sent me the um the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should  
Fred Demargne: code.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: we do  
Fred Demargne: So, I'm going the different domains  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it?  
Fred Demargne: and then one of the domains is supposed to be verse tech.com. Yes, it's here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Should I uh delete this and we create the domain here right now?  
Fred Demargne: It's up to you. You tell me if you the domain  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it doesn't take. If you have access,  
Fred Demargne: exists.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: we uh we can do it right now.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, let me delete this  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: one.  
Fred Demargne: If you tell me what you need, I've got access here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, at domain.com, right? Do you want the email?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, Verso Tech in one  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you want it uh to be mail at  
   
 

### 00:56:25

   
Fred Demargne: word.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: verse? So mail.  
Fred Demargne: Uh so, okay. So, you explain that you don't want to have virtual tech because if there is any uh spam or  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: whatever, we don't want to damage the email. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Especially when we send invite.  
Fred Demargne: does he have to be do we have different it's an alias? No, the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh you can use whatever.  
Fred Demargne: mail.verotche.com.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um tell me mail send um  
Fred Demargne: But what is the most common to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: vers um  
Fred Demargne: do?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: mail send or Yeah, I think these are  
Fred Demargne: Because most if I look at the at the app out there in fintech they I mean let  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: me see um because I've I've got some examples here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: We can use  
Fred Demargne: Where do they send them? They send they send they they have an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.  
Fred Demargne: alias at verse.com but they keep verse.com I mean they will not be verse it would be another but even when  
   
 

### 00:57:39

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I mean, yes.  
Fred Demargne: it come when revolute send emails you know they send emails from  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: revolute.com I'm just going to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Really? I don't  
Fred Demargne: check now because I've got uh two accounts with Revolute for our  
Ghiles Moussaoui: check.  
Fred Demargne: business. Um, so Revolute, yeah, they send an email from no- reply atrevolute.com.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, true.  
Fred Demargne: It says no-rely.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I can see it. Um,  
Fred Demargne: So why don't we use verse.com? Are you sure this is um not the best way? Because if it comes  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, I mean you can see here recommended use separate subdomain to preserve  
Fred Demargne: to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the domain reputation. It's common especially in cold emails or invitations. You can see when I get an invitation um with this there is always can you trust this person? Some people will click no especially because there is a template that is HTML. Um the Google Workspace algorithm clicks on all links and verifies if the link is malicious or normal link.  
   
 

### 00:59:10

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, and this sometimes cause the email to land in spam. And when you lend multiple emails in spam, you get the domain reputation to be broken and and therefore versat.com when you search it, the SEO gets decreased a lot and sometimes it's banned. So, it's very hard to find the website versus versidel.com.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, I need to check in some uh so you so I think what we could do is to use verse.com once the user is already created. But just for the very first email, no to use a different is that what you are  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, we can um Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: suggesting  
Ghiles Moussaoui: but then we will have to pay for resend. For now, I use pay for this service.  
Fred Demargne: would have to do  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's called resend.com.  
Fred Demargne: what?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It allows you to send to connect a domain and create emails and send with those emails.  
Fred Demargne: No, no. I mean that we use we use as you said a subdomain for the first email that we send to to a user because this one could go into spam  
   
 

### 01:00:25

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, yeah,  
Fred Demargne: and we want to protect to preserve uh the domain reputation but then once the user is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: registered all the email that we send could be sent to from verse.com isn't  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, yeah. But uh we will have to we will have to uh create two domains here which are which is you know we have to pay for it for resell.com. So let me check the billing.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Well, so let's use maybe one for the moment. Uh we can always uh change it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So let me see. Let me see on code. What do they recommend? What is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: If if you type a lot with LLMs, there is a trick flow.  
Fred Demargne: reputation? Let me see. What does he says to me? Yeah, they say mail or hello or sales number.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Welcome.  
Fred Demargne: We don't sell. So either either mail. Yeah, let's put mail.verot.com as you

Fred Demargne: yet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And then do the mains. If you go to products and then check your domain. Oops.  
   
 

### 01:03:27

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me just log in. Can you go to DNS directly?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh and then is there an option to create a new DNS? Okay. And when you click on that um you see these types you see  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: this type name value TTL when  
Fred Demargne: Let me see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: you scroll down when you  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I've got type.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So, I can put the t.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Is that what we want?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So um I will send you the values one by one. I will do it in the in the  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: do notion or in email  
Fred Demargne: In notion,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: chat.  
Fred Demargne: you can put directly in the action in notion so that we keep track of it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh email setup. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: I will do it right away. But it's just um then it's documented at the same  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So let me extract this better instead of doing  
   
 

### 01:04:29

   
Fred Demargne: time.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it one by one. So there is four saving tools. Oh, let still edit the values but you can start adding them.  
Fred Demargne: No worries.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: No worries.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Value one is already there. Okay. You have to create them one by one. Uh for once yeah the  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: values the parameters  
Fred Demargne: let me connect. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: change based on the type.  
Fred Demargne: up  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is MX and TXT types.  
Fred Demargne: there that is I understand. Yes. Let me just do it one by one. So txt the name the value up and you say TTL I don't have automatic  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: TTL half an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it means just leave it like that like how I have half an hour. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: hour.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, just leave it like that.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Next one. MX record for sending.  
   
 

### 01:07:41

   
Fred Demargne: Okay. Name priority 10 value feedback. Okay. Add more record. So then you need uh a txt for sending. Okay value this and the TTL is fine. And then the last one I need record for receiving up priority 10 and inbound value inbound up save. Uh is it what does he make this just adding some stuff because it was a link. Okay. Uh I think I can save. Record data is invalid.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.  
Fred Demargne: I know what is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What  
Fred Demargne: invalid.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is  
Fred Demargne: It doesn't say what is invalid. It says uh record data.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the last one?  
Fred Demargne: I said the last one MX record  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, inbound.  
Fred Demargne: for receiving. I put name mail. It's an MX.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: So the only thing could be the value maybe. Are you sure the value you put is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Then you check if you added maybe  
   
 

### 01:10:02

   
Fred Demargne: correct?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um a space or something like that. I enabled it. So it should  
Fred Demargne: because it's a because it's a link.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: be  
Fred Demargne: It's adding some character, but I'm deleting them.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.  
Fred Demargne: H, that works. So, it's been updated.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: everything.  
Fred Demargne: It said has been successfully updated. Yes, but it takes an hour. You have a TTL of an hour, I think.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it's uh here you can see my screen. It's uh looking for DNS in your domain provider. It will check it and once this pending become successful then it's done. I think it doesn't take much uh maybe one two minutes last time I tried it but depends as well. Okay, so this is done. Um we move it to  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I'll do it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: done.  
Fred Demargne: here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure.  
Fred Demargne: I'll leave it to reviewing now for a moment until it's finished and we can move it to done.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
   
 

### 01:11:27

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah. Now what are the  
Fred Demargne: So, what else?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: need?  
Fred Demargne: What else do what else do we need?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so templates, right? Uh yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I do that today.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So three templates and other agreements.  
Fred Demargne: Mhm.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there for example the agreement between the think introducer and the arranger or CEO right there is an agreement I'm not sure how let me just  
Fred Demargne: So tell me what you need.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: check  
Fred Demargne: So you need because I I put only subscription pack. So I thought you just needed a subscription pack.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: no I'm asking if there  
Fred Demargne: So subscription pack. What do you need?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is yeah I just  
Fred Demargne: You just need reconfirmation that the one you've been using is correct. Right.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: need the do you have you told me last time you have a template right for that. So if you share that with me,  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will check if I have the same one or if I have um you know if I got something wrong or something and I could replace it.  
   
 

### 01:12:31

   
Fred Demargne: Okay. Um then you need uh a template for the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: certificate and  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And the DNA NDA, sorry. Uh, and the  
Fred Demargne: what Oh yeah, but I think this one you have the correct one. But I'm just going to check certificate.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: A.  
Fred Demargne: So a new template to be you to be implemented just typing in notion uh implemented then the NDA template. So I think here is to check that the one you use is uh is correct.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: And then you you mention now the introducer  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Is there some kind of an agreement there with also commercial partner?  
Fred Demargne: agreements.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Because I don't have any of those documents. Is it just numbers or uh something that has to be signed?  
Fred Demargne: I mean the idea would be that uh I mean there needs to be a signature is true.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: uh the mostly the the information should be inside uh inside the platform. So in other words uh the commission level should be recorded  
   
 

### 01:14:02

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: inside the platform that we can automatically integrate  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it will be. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it can be both. It can be recorded and also it could be digital format and also document format for signature. Right. So you can see workflow is okay. CEO create introducer agreement.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Dispatch agreement to introducer. Introducer reviews can add comments. Approve sign digitally. CEO counter sign agreement active or rejecting the negotiation out of  
Fred Demargne: So here here normally for the signature I don't know if I mean it's written in a in a requirement page but  
Ghiles Moussaoui: app.  
Fred Demargne: if it's not clear for you the idea is when the document is sent for the other party to sign it the CEO already signed  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I get it.  
Fred Demargne: it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: We discussed this before. Coatically  
Fred Demargne: So, so, so the CEO does not come to sign it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: It's pre-signed. And then once the once the  
   
 

### 01:15:03

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: uh it's done.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Good. We can move it to done. So, uh Okay. Up. Done. Okay. Uh so, I will put the template. I will check for all of this. What  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah now I think it matters of uh if the processes are correct  
Fred Demargne: else?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and how do you want to start testing um them right.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. So that's going to be the action the question for me for actions for you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So  
Fred Demargne: I think maybe one one action that we should put in the canban is documentation uh user documentation.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. And how  
Fred Demargne: Um I think at the moment is more on your side  
Ghiles Moussaoui: looking  
Fred Demargne: to initiate the document and then I will need to update it probably with some clarification and so on. But I think the structure of the document is going to be probably going to be easier for you to start it.  
   
 

### 01:16:06

   
Fred Demargne: What do you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I just need to know what type of documents because this is when uh you know versat  
Fred Demargne: think?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: processes this is basically something uh for everything. I'm sure it doesn't cover 100% but in 95% there I can create a pro uh for each process document and yeah I just need to know what type of documentation because Oh,  
Fred Demargne: It's a user It's a user  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: guide.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You mean docs for how to use a platform? Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Understood.  
Fred Demargne: So I I don't think you can finish it by yourself because some of it needs to be probably written by me or Julian maybe will have comments but I think the initiation of the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: document uh is probably needs probably to be you uh because you know I as I said I cannot go into all the details about the platform now because we have I don't have enough time.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh so I put one a one task in my canban assigned to you which is user guides for you to start deciding how you want to do it.  
   
 

### 01:17:13

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Um let me just uh maybe specify that this is a document. So, this is a standard user guide document that we could potentially share with users and that can be used uh for troubleshooting for troubleshooting internally. Okay. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: That's it.  
Fred Demargne: I think that's for the moment. So, me now I've got questions for you. Uh, unless you have still more more questions for me.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah so I have two more questions which is gaps in the workflow in the processes um  
Fred Demargne: Tell  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for the journey of investment there is um so there is a resale after  
Fred Demargne: me.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: everything is done but there is also redemption events and conversion events that we I didn't  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: really  
Fred Demargne: understand. Okay. The did you discuss any of those three with Julian before or that would be the first time?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: account for them and if I should add them uh right now.  
Fred Demargne: Sorry, I didn't hear I didn't catch what you just  
   
 

### 01:19:02

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: said.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um is it something I should add before the launch or how does it  
Fred Demargne: Yes,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: work?  
Fred Demargne: that's why I asked you the question. Is it something that you already discussed with Julian or that would be the first time?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: know the resale even I never discussed it with Julian you were the first one to mention mention  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it to me so  
Fred Demargne: So what what we um what we had always discussed and maybe that's something that I need to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: here  
Fred Demargne: review as part of the of the the plan for production that the resell it was not going to be the uh priority at the very beginning.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah get  
Fred Demargne: Um so this I would I would need to double check with Julian if he has changed his mind but in normally the resell it's it's not that critical it will become so we will need to do it but uh I wouldn't say that  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: you need to do it for the 9th or for the 10th um so  
   
 

### 01:20:00

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: for resell just to explain this means that basically once an investor has invested  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry, the resale is implemented for now. There isn't a document for reselling or how to convert the money, but there is a process where the investor can click a button, resell a percentage or everything which creates an approval in CEO or arranger. Once that is accepted um the subscription becomes canceled or like resailed or like partially uh you know sold.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. No, I know exactly what it is. Um, so let I was trying to explain.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So, uh, uh, basically the the idea is the following just to for you to understand what it means.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: For sure.  
Fred Demargne: I agree that you understood the process. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: but it's the what what does that mean? That means that basically you are an existing investor and you want somebody  
Ghiles Moussaoui: great.  
Fred Demargne: to buy your position either entirely or partially from you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
   
 

### 01:21:23

   
Fred Demargne: So today we have mostly used it for Julian.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.  
Fred Demargne: No, Julian um invest his own money in some investments  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: because that's the principle that we we take the risk together with our  
Ghiles Moussaoui: of course.  
Fred Demargne: clients and then at some point obviously yeah new new  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: investors are are contacting us and and Julian is able to welcome those investors by selling his shares. So that's the main use case.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So in my in my opinion since you have never discussed it with Julian, this is not something that we will have for this week. Okay?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Don't uh don't work on new functionality like this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Got it.  
Fred Demargne: Um conversion uh let me explain to you what the conversion uh is. So depending on the product type uh sometime when you invest in a investment opportunity this is you are not investing in shares you are investing in what we call  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah.  
Fred Demargne: notes and those notes at some  
   
 

### 01:22:29

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So is it is it an IPO  
Fred Demargne: point will be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: thing? Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: converted  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it um is it based on specific criteria? Say if they are preipo and they go public and your shares become tradable and you can receive the  
Fred Demargne: Not for conversion. No,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: shares.  
Fred Demargne: not for conver. So both conversion and redemption are triggered by us in the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,  
Fred Demargne: platform. They they are only triggered.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.  
Fred Demargne: Obviously we are not we are not generating those events because we decide to.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: But the way they will work in the platform is we trigger them  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I get it.  
Fred Demargne: and then because we trigger those events then that has impact on the holdings of the investors uh um that have  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: fin and flow of funds new flow of funds that starts especially for redemption.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: for conversion that could be or not but for redemption there will always be uh  
   
 

### 01:23:30

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: a flow of funds. So again if you never discuss this with Julian that's not the time to work on this now  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: because we need to we need to focus on what we  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.  
Fred Demargne: have  
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Um, and the rest is the processes. I don't know if you'd like to go through them and tell me if anything is wrong because I will use this to test, right, for dispatching. Um,  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, let's do it then. Let's do that. Let's Let's start from the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: of the document.  
Fred Demargne: beginning.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So this is workflows uh corrections tables the core business model. So there is sour source deals create vehicles and terms plans term sheet and uh sorry MBA distribution dispatch to investors life cycle management until exit. Uh  
Fred Demargne: Uh wait wait wait wait. Um subscription  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay  
Fred Demargne: tax and signature certificate should be under distribution.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
   
 

### 01:24:54

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it. Yeah. Yes, that is correct. Uh that I know uh revenue streams.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there something else?  
Fred Demargne: Subscription fee, management fee, performance fee, spread. We don't say markup, we say spread. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: yeah, you have um I mean introducer fee is not a revenue stream. I mean,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You pay it.  
Fred Demargne: what do you mean?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's something you pay, right?  
Fred Demargne: Yes. So, it's not a revenue, it's a cost. The introduction,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: the introdu introducer fee is a cost.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: But that's okay if you want to keep it on. But so, you have more things. So you have  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I know for example that there could be multiple performance fees.  
Fred Demargne: um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Performance fee one and then based on a threshold, right?  
Fred Demargne: yes and then you have another concept which is a hurdle.  
   
 

### 01:26:02

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh so you mean the performance fee only applies from a specific uh performance of the of the stock but this is part  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: of a performance fee at this level.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh  
Fred Demargne: I think it's okay. I mean, there's introducer fees you need. I don't know what BD means.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um introducer PD partner. No, I'm not sure.  
Fred Demargne: You can you can get rid of BD. I think um it is not only paid from subscription fees. Sometime the introduction fees are paid from the spread. They can be paid from the subscription fees and they can be paid also from the performance fee. It's either one of the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: three.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. I I will check it out later from the meeting. I prefer not to edit.  
Fred Demargne: And here you need to add So you need to add partner fees, commercial partner fees,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: and you need to add uh brokerage fees.  
   
 

### 01:27:14

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: brokerage fees. Okay. Yeah, we'll add it later. So, this is um I think the the revenue the reason it was here  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is because um maybe you can be an introducer as well because I think the platform allows multiple arrangers ability, right? Not just vers management. So, if there's multiple arrangers Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: J mentioned that for the moment we are focusing on one aranger.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is just business logic. Yeah. Okay, I got it. Persona map.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, so this is I think more in the platform. So there is user, there is internal persona, CEO, arranger, mostly managers, right? hybrid persona. There is partner, introducer can also be investor and there is more external which is lawyer and commercial partner. Uh and there is  
Fred Demargne: for me um partner or internal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: in  
Fred Demargne: I don't know if it's internal, hybrid, external is the right category. I think you should just uh here um put all the different  
   
 

### 01:28:28

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's terminology.  
Fred Demargne: persona CEO. So you've got one, two, three, four, five, six. six persona.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is CEO, there's a investor,  
Fred Demargne: Uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: partner, introducer and lawyer and commercial partner.  
Fred Demargne: yeah, because you know Julian as a CEO maybe  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I know.  
Fred Demargne: investing.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um that is that is done. Um this is just a small map splitting them into something you  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: would understand.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah before it was staff and investor. So I had it's also in the technicalities what they have access to for the APIs like the end points when they go to to a URL even if they don't have the button in the UI maybe they go to a URL maybe based on their persona they don't have access to something specific right yeah so okay hierarchy uh primary  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: function uh full administration okay this is just what they too. Yeah. So, okay.  
   
 

### 01:29:36

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: CEO can also be investor for platform administration. Arranger D management for assigned vehicles uh can be an investor. Can an arranger be an investor?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, in a very specific case that could be the case, but it's not the most  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Just the ability to be.  
Fred Demargne: common.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So um partner can be investor refers investors share deals. Um introducer from the introduction agreement uh commercial partner wealth with manager executes for client can be investor especially lawyer cannot be investor and investor is already  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: investor. Okay. Works persona explained. Uh CEO staff ro administration.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um create all user profiles. Create and manage investment opportunities. Deal plus term sheet. Dispatch opportunity investment external parties. Create and assign fee models. Uh approve KYC submission subscriptions. Manage reconciliations and financial oversight. Uh issue equity certificate and statements of holdings. handle conversions and redemption events. Um, so a lot of this is done automatically with approvals.  
   
 

### 01:30:50

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you remember approval, you have to approve something for for example gen the subscription, right? You have to approve so that the subscription pack is generated. This is done via the CEO. I'm sure there is some stuff that we have to take from the CEO and give it to the arrangers but for now it's uh like that.  
Fred Demargne: but they issue equity certificate. We don't need the CEO to approve.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah yeah yeah this is not approval um yes I agree  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um co dashboard so there's dashboard users DS vehicle subscription subscription pack is inside subscriptions approvals we went through it fees we did not really go through it but I think it's pretty straightforward reconciliations it's matching transactions with what um investments are inside the platform. There's an algorithm that auto matches if you create I named it invoice but it's mostly okay there is subscription that is not funded or partially funded when transaction arrives you put the transaction in the platform takes the transactions and pro gives you a potentially match with the with the name of the person that paid and also a specific subscription you can approve it or put a manual uh thing matching make sure that everything is tracked and when it's funded.  
   
 

### 01:32:14

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, you know, when it's over the over how much they had to pay, you can issue a refund and stuff like that. Give us a review, introducers, partners, commercial partners, lawyers, audit blogs. So, yeah. Um,  
Fred Demargne: But here we see that we need to simplify all the the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. Yeah. So,  
Fred Demargne: menu.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I simplified it. I put users. I create users for everything, but I kept these because uh I just, you know, no need to delete them for now. I can delete them or I can just hide them from the sidebar. But because it's a CEO, uh it's not investor, I just kept it to see maybe it will be useful later  
Fred Demargne: But there was um there was other things like messages and stuff that we we said that we need  
Ghiles Moussaoui: on.  
Fred Demargne: to gather together with um I understand for me the approvals um they were going together with notifications or stuff. No. Uh let me try to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for yeah the tasks are going together with notifications but this is for the  
   
 

### 01:33:18

   
Fred Demargne: recon  
Ghiles Moussaoui: investor approvals I kept it for CEO because uh you have to approve some stuff to go through the platform for example if a person invites her if um a persona invites a member you'd like to approve uh that they can invite So the invitation goes through when somebody uh has once uh it's like a kill switch as well. You want to approve multiple things. I think later we can streamline it and remove that human interloop for approvals especially let's say somebody you know wants an NDA for um a deal room u a data room and their KYC is not reviewed you can see it and you can see the status of their KYC or something specific and you can reject it with um maybe some explanation and know what you can add or approve it and similarly for a subscription uh if it's under the amount that you have. So it's just to manage uh things, right? Let's say you have 25 million and 25 million is reached. Maybe you cannot accept another subscription. So you will u maybe either reject it or reach out to the investor to have something more um specific.  
   
 

### 01:34:42

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Maybe they have made the mistake to invest 150 million. You just want to approve every time.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I'm connected at the same time. I'm trying to understand. I'm connected to the to the platform of the CEO.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What's  
Fred Demargne: Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: one?  
Fred Demargne: so I agree that the audit is very something very specific. There's no problem with that. Uh, that's okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Let  
Fred Demargne: Uh my problem is just that I feel like there will be multiple duplicates  
Ghiles Moussaoui: me  
Fred Demargne: of on the left hand side which by the way on the on the app on the mobile is is stuck but  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah I know the mobile it did not work on the mobile so okay so I am a CEO inside I kept the messages to be clear messages is now only with  
Fred Demargne: Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: investors I did not implement it for other persona us as I did not find it in the user stories and uh yeah so Julian mentioned it to me so I just kept it between CEO and investor if I go to approvals um it's to approve deal interest and when you click on it you have more uh information uh so the deal information investor information you can see KYC is approved or not the type request details how much they have requested and  
   
 

### 01:36:13

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: the timeline and also the data if you want to uh the deeper look in the data is JSON format here but yeah and you can start a message or rejector approved um I don't know how how else or if needs to be changed we discussed that you want to merge um messages and approvals but I think it's the last time you said,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: "Okay, let's focus uh on getting the other stuff done." So,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh before the lunch,  
Fred Demargne: I'm just trying to find a compromise here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right?  
Fred Demargne: What is I think here um we need to see when we're going to test. Uh I don't think you should we should make any assumptions yet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: Um yeah, let's see when we test Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: and actually I I will need you to create more CEO persona uh more CEO users because I need to get people involved to test with me.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. Yeah, I can do  
Fred Demargne: So one co user you need you can put I can send you in the chat at least uh for now it doesn't matter if the same address is  
   
 

### 01:37:40

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Give me the Can you uh  
Fred Demargne: used for production and for testing the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: emails email addresses? You mean?  
Fred Demargne: email addresses yes yeah but no I  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it doesn't matter. I can wipe it out after.  
Fred Demargne: the idea that we will keep the same users for testing Even after the the the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: environment goes into  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah,  
Fred Demargne: production.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean you can't use both because it's one database, right? So if you use one email address and it's connected to an account uh then you will just have to delete that account and actually we will have to do that because this I just used CTO at Versa Holdings for this email of the CEO. So we  
Fred Demargne: No, I I agree. When we move to production,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: got  
Fred Demargne: we need to we need to uh delete all the data in the environment and then load the data.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: My my question is I want to make I I don't want to have to recreate new testing  
   
 

### 01:38:43

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: users after we move to production under verse. What I understood from the previous conversation that we had since the domain will be verse tech the versel.app will remain intact isn't it?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, the data changes.  
Fred Demargne: So we will not be able to continue the testing that we would have that we started this week after after we go to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, I think Oh, okay. Um, okay. So,  
Fred Demargne: production.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the testing is mainly done via data, I believe. So, with Okay. Which means when you interact with the database via everything sending messages any process interacts with database creates three cards database there is only one environment the especially because I was using free there isn't a stage in our testing environment there is only one project uh for everything so say we we are testing up until the end uh the 10th of January and we launch we have to wipe up all of the test data to have production environment to you know to have everything there but to to go and  
   
 

### 01:40:08

   
Fred Demargne: we cannot we cannot we cannot create a new so I understood this I remember you mentioned that  
Ghiles Moussaoui: test.  
Fred Demargne: so once we get ready for the production environment.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Can we not just have another set of database a new ones based on the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah I can I can  
Fred Demargne: same structure? So we keep we keep the existing one for testing that remain the same and we  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: just duplicate it because then we would have paid the uh superbase uh plan.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think yeah if it is possible it will be done. I think it is possible. So  
Fred Demargne: I think I think that would be better to do it like this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So we we recreate a fresh environment for production uh with all the data there will be no data in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: it but the the the environment for testing remains after we move to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: production.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get it.  
Fred Demargne: So if this is possible then uh we can use the same email addresses  
   
 

### 01:41:13

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh,  
Fred Demargne: because we will just connect to different portals.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yes, that is correct.  
Fred Demargne: One which is a production portal and one which is a testing  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that is correct. And I believe even like if you want to use one database for everything,  
Fred Demargne: portal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: you can still do that a little bit as long as you don't interact with production accounts, not environment. So say you have a test account for each persona or multiple test accounts for multiple personas. The email is registered inside the platform. You can just add it to another persona. So say you have your production account, you also have test accounts. You can go to the test accounts, you can do anything you want, but it will have no impact whatsoever on the production accounts a CEO as others as well.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh but say you log in with a test account to the CEO because CEO there would be probably one or one production account and one uh test account. If you go uh to investors and you delete an investor that currently exists, that will in affect it, right?  
   
 

### 01:42:19

   
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, I think CEO, we need to have uh me.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I'm putting uh I'm putting the uh in a canban board. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. This  
Fred Demargne: Uh,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: document.  
Fred Demargne: I just added uh a task called testing credentials and I'm editing it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh, I'm going to put the deadline for today. That is done. So, uh, for CEO I need to add myself. Um, for investor we need to add Ashish. I'm going to put the email  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: address.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, you could as well. Uh, I see. Let me see if I can explain. With one email account, you can have all personas and you can go test everything. See here, I logged in with this email and they have arrangers, introducers, partners, commercial partners, and lawyer.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And I can switch.  
Fred Demargne: but how do you how do you test like this the different notifications?  
   
 

### 01:43:43

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Notifications are here. Uh when you switch  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, you need to differentiate the notification that you will receive as a partner,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: everything.  
Fred Demargne: notification that you will receive as an investor.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Everything switches. The entire persona switches. You can see sidebar switches. Um dashboard switches.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So see if you are a CEO and also investor, you don't have to go log out. You can just change this because it's the same password, the same email you're using. You just have two different accounts for specific, you know,  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: persona accounts. So, yeah, this is  
Fred Demargne: But then I can so so okay so I can I'm going to tell I'm going to put in the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh  
Fred Demargne: task who want which email address and for which persona and  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: from what what I understand from you is some email address can be associated to multiple persona with the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And yes. Yep.  
Fred Demargne: same email.  
   
 

### 01:44:42

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Every every person if you  
Fred Demargne: All right.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: want.  
Fred Demargne: I don't think we need um so we're gonna have uh two email addresses for investor only.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh I think we need this to so that they like they really behave like they are an investor. And then for me uh I need to be uh CEO admin um partner introducer. Yeah, I basically need to have all the roles.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: I'm just putting just for sake of clarity. introducer lawyer uh an aranger of course and then the question is should I add another email address for me just limited roles does I make a does I had a value I don't know what do you think should I use another email address of mine to have a specific role  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for um as you want. You can I believe also have uh With one email you can have multiple arrangers and multiple CEOs, multiple everything.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I just I just think that maybe sometime it will be confusing. So I'm just wondering whether for testing purposes I should also have even though I'm going to ask you to  
   
 

### 01:46:18

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh  
Fred Demargne: set up set me up as multiple persona but maybe I should have one email address for a specific role.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, you can do that.  
Fred Demargne: Well we can still delete it. So I'm going to do that. I'm going to offer you I'm going to define up investor only and I'm going to put another email on mine just to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Thank  
Fred Demargne: simplify.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: you.  
Fred Demargne: Uh, I'm going to put investor and introducer partner slash introducer and then I will be able to use multiple introducers, multiple partners. Yeah, I think that's okay. Like this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, if you can work on this for me,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah,  
Fred Demargne: uh, that will be helpful.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will get it set uh directly after the call. Um Just set it up  
Fred Demargne: Uh I mean the idea is maybe I need to so you need to create the one my  
Ghiles Moussaoui: here.  
Fred Demargne: the the because I need to create them. I need to create the investors.  
   
 

### 01:47:43

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: Uh maybe it's better we do it like this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So you just create with my email address versus holding email address my profile and then the rest is I do it myself.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. If it's Yeah, that works.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Another thing interesting question in parallel the KYC right in the user stories  
Fred Demargne: yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh there is some personas that don't have KYC or KYC is admin level so it's not the platform for example lawyer KYC for  
Fred Demargne: So say it again.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: some personas are also So is it all the same thing because through the user stories they  
Fred Demargne: Yes. Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: didn't find that.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. It's all the same.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So all of them have to submit KYC even the law firms that you worked with and everything  
Fred Demargne: I mean um if they want to invest, yes,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: but  
Fred Demargne: if they don't want to invest, they don't have to provide the full KYC.  
   
 

### 01:48:57

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: lawyer.  
Fred Demargne: Um but they still have the possibility to do it, but it's not a mandatory field if they don't want to invest.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So you want the ability for all of the personas to put the KYC. Uh just because I think lawyer cannot be investor but I think everybody can be. Yeah. Okay. Understood. Um All right. Should we continue the processes?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You have questions for me after. This is a CEO key workflow, user onboarding and approval, deal creation, term sheet management, opportunity, dispatch, subscription pack generation. This is done automatically. Funding confirmation. Uh funding confirmation. This is for lawyers right from the escro account. Certificate issuance is automatically. Conversion redemption events implemented. Okay. Arranger persona role licensed financial entity management special vehicle deals key capabilities. view and manage deal assigned to their vehicles. Create feod for partners and introducers. Yeah, here arranger um are they assigned deals or are they assigned vehicles or both?  
   
 

### 01:50:19

   
Fred Demargne: They don't they don't assign they are uh each vehicle is assign  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, they are assigned.  
Fred Demargne: so each for each vehicle we have an assigned arranger.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. So it's on the vehicle level, not on the deal level.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I mean,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: All  
Fred Demargne: yeah, it's at the vehicle level. Uh,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right.  
Fred Demargne: so you have a new deal. The is decided which vehicle that we're going to use and for that vehicle that the aranger is assigned. Yes, that's correct.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Few models for partners and introducers. introduces an agreement for partners. It's a fee model, right?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh introducer agreement is it done one? Is it a global agreement?  
Fred Demargne: it's for each  
Ghiles Moussaoui: For each deal,  
Fred Demargne: deals  
Ghiles Moussaoui: there's a different uh for introducer  
Fred Demargne: for each deal and for each in and potentially for each investor.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: because Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So the reason why you have this is you know for for each uh in  
   
 

### 01:51:27

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: each vehicles you can have multiple term sheet for the same investment for the same company where you are investing in. So the fee model is associated to the term  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.  
Fred Demargne: sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, there it is. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So when you when you create a deal, you create a term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: The term sheet is the core database that is used to define the fee models. And you can have multiple term sheet per  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: deals.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So yeah, because before I did not understand it like this. I had more like um uh if it partners fee models. Every time you dispatch a partner to a deal, you have to give them a fee model, right? Something from  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. And you could you could dispatch to for the same in under the same  
Ghiles Moussaoui: scratch.  
Fred Demargne: vehicles. You can dispatch multiple term sheets um with the same partners and each term sheet will be associated to a different  
   
 

### 01:52:54

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: fe  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh I have to think about how to engineer this and how it is engineered. uh because for now it was for introducer there is a global agreement that you can edit but it cover it's like between introducer and um introducer and deal yeah introducer and deal or introducer and CEO which means it covers all of the their deals and investors but for partners every time you dispatch to deal you can change it or apply some something Okay, the term sheet, but the term sheet doesn't have something specific for introducers or  
Fred Demargne: No,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: partners.  
Fred Demargne: but the the specificity of the term sheet leads to define the fee models one way or the other.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So,  
Fred Demargne: Example,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's dependent.  
Fred Demargne: imagine in the term sheet there is no subscription fees.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, it's dependent, right?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So the way we had built the data model for the application, the term sheet was a core database for a deal because you can have multiple term sheet for one  
   
 

### 01:54:11

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: deal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: So the temp sheet doesn't have the directly the in the the the the records that you need to have in a femodel database but the temp sheet conditioned the female database.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay should I invest in trends? Yeah. So h because they implemented also an inheritance term sheet is associated to fee plans. Fee fee plans is a template and the fee plans also convert after the subscription is created automatically. They take either a default fee plan uh that is from the term sheet and so you have the final fee events and when there is something uh that changes in between um there is also some mechanism for that and if he ends  
Fred Demargne: No, there is no um default fee plan.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: there is a default  
Fred Demargne: You you have a term sheet. The term sheet is defining the deal for the investors. So here there is no relation direct relationship between the term the term sheet and the introducers or the partners. There is none.  
   
 

### 01:55:50

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes,  
Fred Demargne: It's it's an offer for an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I know. Yeah. Um,  
Fred Demargne: investor.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: a default. I thought for deal there will be a default.  
Fred Demargne: A default  
Ghiles Moussaoui: N Julian explained this to me. uh for a specific deal opportunity there should be a  
Fred Demargne: one.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: default uh term sheet or default fee plan let's say which is like  
Fred Demargne: So it's not a default.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: 2%  
Fred Demargne: You have a template if you want a structure.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah  
Fred Demargne: But then you need to define every single time the information is there is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah yeah it's not default for everyone  
Fred Demargne: no def  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for every opportunity I mean it's default for each and every single opportunity because for each and every single opportunity you can have multiple fee plans and multiple term sheets. But there is a default one if you don't change anything that is the one that will be uh you know used through the automatic process of extracting the fee plans that are been have been applied to a specific uh subscription or investment opportunity through the process to later calculate each fees for the commissioner for introducer and partner and also for um what the investor pays and all.  
   
 

### 01:57:06

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean you can see everything in the platform and in case anything in the report there is the feedback you can see all the terms so you can edit everything as well.  
Fred Demargne: I I don't know the the the only problem I have is you you seem to be putting in the same uh sentence two things which are completely different. The term sheet is a document.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: We have a template. we need to be able to uh edit.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: So to export the template with the data and send it,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: we need to be able to do that. But so the the the what we have is we have a template for for a term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: This this term sheet has no is not going to be sent to the introducer to the partner. No, it's it's sent to the investor. We can just derive from the term sheet the fee model.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's written  
Fred Demargne: Uh so so so that that's the temp sheet  
   
 

### 01:58:17

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: inside.  
Fred Demargne: is not sent to a partner to an introducer.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is this uh Okay, sorry. Great for now. Um, okay. Can you see my screen?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I can see  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can see this is the template for term sheet,  
Fred Demargne: him.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? You can create a new one. This is the template and it is also a document that you can upload in an attachment. Put it as a term sheet.  
Fred Demargne: So, how does it look like if you upload it? Just for me to see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh I don't have a term sheet but it's just a document that you addit and it will be just some document uh and the investor have access to it to download it from the investment opportunities page if you remember  
Fred Demargne: Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: like nothing happens here when you upload it it's just an uploaded term sheet and this is digital so you can just edit uh changes it. Clone it. Um, archive it.  
   
 

### 01:59:24

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Put it as published.  
Fred Demargne: But when you say upload attachment, we we we are not able. I just would like to see how it looks like.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me test it. Yeah. So, it's uh just uploaded.  
Fred Demargne: Ah okay. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So we should be able to download it and specific  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, okay. Not.  
Fred Demargne: format anyway.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think.  
Fred Demargne: It's not  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I think it's something that you will find in documents under the deal specific thing.  
Fred Demargne: u  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can have it here and you can either uh preview with a document or download it. Yeah, there is normally preview. I think it's uh okay. So what I wanted to say is when you create the term sheet here, you upload the document,  
Fred Demargne: Mhm.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the investor has access to it, right? They can see these terms, minimum ticket, maximum ticket,  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: price per share, uh purchaser, capital call, timeline, and everything.  
   
 

### 02:00:43

   
Fred Demargne: Where where did you get those field  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and the doc um Julian shared with me the term  
Fred Demargne: from?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sheet examples and so I turned that into  
Fred Demargne: Because there is no maximum ticket in the term  
Ghiles Moussaoui: digital  
Fred Demargne: sheet  
Ghiles Moussaoui: let me check  
Fred Demargne: and there are field which are missing here. Um um carried interest legal council. You are missing the the closing date.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So this is indicative term sheet. This is for example something that Julian shared with me. Maximum ticket. Uh this this is what I used to create those fields and they have it  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, we use the different um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for VC 203, VC 215 and uh 206.  
Fred Demargne: here we are missing a a closing  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So  
Fred Demargne: date.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, but  
Fred Demargne: uh terms allocation. So we have a we should have an in issuance. Okay, I need to send you the the proper template for the term sheet.  
   
 

### 02:02:14

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Just do and for closing date,  
Fred Demargne: Um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: close date. Yeah. Um there is information on D level on and also term sheet level, right? There is like deal name. Uh you can associate stage because it's deal. So you can put name the arranger um timeline a description and investment thesis which you could edit and you can put the close date as well here. There we are. So, you could share with me the term sheet and the the  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: template.  
Fred Demargne: I add it to my action in templates for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Great.  
Fred Demargne: today.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh,  
Fred Demargne: Okay, going back to the conversation.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: so I was Yep.  
Fred Demargne: So, we have a term sheet. I agree this is a principle.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: Uh, so what you call what you mentioned by default is the fact that we can clone an existing term sheet. I understand now it's not that there is a default it's just that there is a default model um but then the fee  
   
 

### 02:03:40

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So when you input the term sheet here, these specific uh subscriptions uh the fees etc. creates an automatic fee plan. And when I go to create a fee plan or edit this one, I have this. I have basic information fee plan description uh apply to deal global. So global which means just default active set as default is just label and they have components which for go from uh fee type subscription management performance spread markup fiat fee fiat fee broker dealer fee and fenra fee and other and based on that you have specific changes in the fields I believe. Uh but  
Fred Demargne: but I don't understand is global and uh I'm sorry I I don't get  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah,  
Fred Demargne: it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: you can apply it to multiple fees uh from  
Fred Demargne: but you will never you you you should never do this because it's it's a very it's a big risk.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. So I if I remember Julian said me that they have to do this  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, we should we should not have this possibility to apply a fee model to every single investment opportunity, every single investor and so on introducer.  
   
 

### 02:05:08

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: We should define we every time we create a new deal we need to recreate the whole structure because we need to think about it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: We need to think about the consistency between the term sheets, the fee models. You know, every time uh Julian enter into a conversation with a introducer, he needs to think about the deal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: He needs to think about the the the the structure of the deal and then depending on this and the fee model  
Ghiles Moussaoui: good.  
Fred Demargne: will be different.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So if we if by mistake he just apply a female to every single investment  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,  
Fred Demargne: opportunity that will generate a problem  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yes. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: potentially  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. My question is the fe models table uh what is it connected to and what what are the variables?  
Fred Demargne: sheets.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it connected to uh deal level which covers everything that connects to deals, investor level, introducer level and also partner levels or all of  
   
 

### 02:06:15

   
Fred Demargne: It's connected to the term sheet the female and it's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: them.  
Fred Demargne: connected to uh the introducer. Then the introducer is connected to the investor.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So because there will be variation when you put one introducer and you change the uh investor it's two different rows in the database of he model you can edit that and similarly when you have a different deal but the same investor same introducer so it's it varies in every single direction. Is that what you're saying?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, it's it's David. I mean you have different relationship between the tables. So you have a term sheet table which is associated to the female  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: table. uh and then you need to associate the fee model table to the different  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: introducers and then the fee model is not directly linked to an investor is just the introducer for that particular term sheet for that particular investor associated and the term sheet is associated to a deal because you could have as part of one deal you could have two term sheets.  
   
 

### 02:07:31

   
Fred Demargne: The two term sheet sent to the same investor associated to different fe model with the same introducers. So that's why in a deal what is super important is a term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So  
Fred Demargne: The term sheet is really the the the cornerstone of the of the deal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. So you can have multiple term sheets. Um and from my understanding the fee plans what is the difference between term and fee  
Fred Demargne: The difference is uh the the fee models only  
Ghiles Moussaoui: plans.  
Fred Demargne: only structure the commercial relationship between an introducer and the arranger. So um you will not mention the allocation up to you will not necessarily mention the price per share because you would only say imagine um imagine the introduction fee  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand.  
Fred Demargne: is based on a on a on a part of the share.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh so if the price per share is $300 as you had in your example no $300. Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I understand.  
Fred Demargne: Imagine that uh the price that we paid for it uh is 100. Um  
   
 

### 02:09:05

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: the spread.  
Fred Demargne: huh.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the spread counts.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So you can share a part of the spread to um to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: the to the introducer.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I get it. And what I  
Fred Demargne: So here in the fee models instead of seeing 300 you will see 50. There will not be minimal tickets you will  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't have then the template for fee models because fee models is just the  
Fred Demargne: uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: subscription types and the numbers associated to it and obviously also the people uh you know the personas associated to it, the deals, the transactions but there isn't Um there isn't for  
Fred Demargne: No,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: example  
Fred Demargne: the the yeah the the the fee model is I think  
Ghiles Moussaoui: this  
Fred Demargne: here before you were missing the spread uh that could be shared as we discussed before uh in the call uh but the fee model is mostly numbers I agree with you it's mostly subscription fee management fee spread performance fee uh if if  
   
 

### 02:10:23

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: if one of the fee do not apply it should not appear. So if if we put 0% to management fee that we shouldn't  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You just don't Yeah. You just don't edit it.  
Fred Demargne: show.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You don't have the component. If you remove it, there is no  
Fred Demargne: Perfect. Perfect.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: component.  
Fred Demargne: Uh and then and then there is a template to edit the document the uh the agreement which has some legal terminology and then the fees.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: which the agreement with introducer.  
Fred Demargne: Yes, we discussed I need to share with  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And the other thing is synchronization.  
Fred Demargne: you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is synchronized between term sheet and fee plans? Because if it's not one to one, how do you so one in one term sheet can have multiple fee  
Fred Demargne: one to many.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: plans.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And so when you edit the turn sheet, all of the feed plans are edited or how does it work?  
Fred Demargne: Now manually the CEO needs to uh edit different  
   
 

### 02:11:27

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: femals  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What I'm trying to also understand is the fee plans are they created automatically when I create a term sheet or is it something that is done manually as well?  
Fred Demargne: is manually.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh and ideally you when you edit manually a new free plan, a free free model,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So  
Fred Demargne: then you have um uh uh we have uh we have a reference a term sheet associated to it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: term sheet. Yeah. So this just Okay. Wait. Um I'm trying to think of it also in engineering way because okay this is one to many and it should be created manually never automatically and you should choose the term sheet that is associated to it from a dropdown I suppose but on the deal level is that correct  
Fred Demargne: temp sheet level.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: But the term sheet is associated to a deal specifically, right?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but you can have multiple time sheet for one deal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. But it's still one deal.  
Fred Demargne: So in the 10th  
   
 

### 02:12:49

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, so it's on deal level and then uh so let's say you have a dropdown but  
Fred Demargne: level  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's categorized or grouped by deal and you select the deal and then you have the drop down of all the term sheet the published one and non-published one that you have is that correct and then you create the  
Fred Demargne: yes  
Ghiles Moussaoui: fee plan from there but when you create it do you also put the same numbers or or how does it So,  
Fred Demargne: the numbers will depend on the time sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: but yeah,  
Fred Demargne: That's why  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's the same numbers from the term sheet.  
Fred Demargne: you mean you mean the field or the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What I mean is is it synchronized the the numbers for example the subscription  
Fred Demargne: numbers.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: fee, the performance fee, the management fee is it inherit?  
Fred Demargne: So every time you have a new term sheet those numbers could be different and therefore  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. But when you  
Fred Demargne: the key model associated to it will be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: create  
Fred Demargne: different.  
   
 

### 02:13:43

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh I don't understand then  
Fred Demargne: Look uh I'm giving you an example.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: because  
Fred Demargne: If you have two term sheet, one has subscription fee 2%. Another one has subscription fee 0%.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah  
Fred Demargne: Then the fee model to the term sheet number one might have 1% as a fee model. The the second fee model associated to the second term sheet will not have any subscription fee as a fee model because there are 0% in the term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: But what why uh what is the difference then? Like what is the relationship and  
Fred Demargne: Okay, let me explain it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: which  
Fred Demargne: Okay, I think I think what you are missing here is to understand. So the term sheet is a conditions to the investor. If you put 2% it means of subscription fee it means the investor pays 2% to the arranger.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So this is  
Fred Demargne: If you have 0% the investor do not pay any subscription fee.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So the arranger cannot pay a fee that he has not received from the investor.  
   
 

### 02:14:57

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: That is a link. So if the term sheet says 0% subscription fee then the upfront amount in a fee model with the introducer cannot be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: the same that if is the another term sheet a different investor did pay 2% as a fee one shot when he  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. So,  
Fred Demargne: invested.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: there is a range for each number from it's from zero to the number  
Fred Demargne: Exactly.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um, is there any other columns, price per share,  
Fred Demargne: The price per share is linked to the spread.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: etc.  
Fred Demargne: So that could be from zero to the maximum spread. The management fee will be from zero to the management fee in the term sheet. And then the performance fee will be from zero to the performance fee in the term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. And now I need to understand the inheritance and when something is done automatically synchronization between term sheet or feed plans and subscriptions. So for investor this is the source of truth which means this is what is used uh when they subscribe to something right.  
   
 

### 02:16:22

   
Fred Demargne: Mhm. Got the term s***.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: when when yeah but for the introducer  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and the partner commission partner the fee plans is what happens for them right the fees for them the commissions is it extracted from the fee plans or the term sheet I don't think from the term sheet if I understand correctly it comes from the fee plans and what is associated to them and the deal  
Fred Demargne: Yes. Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right okay Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And I think that is everything. Okay. And so I will have to change this and the fees and add the ability to create fee models. Uh all right.  
Fred Demargne: In a data model, we really need to have the term sheet as a backbone of a deal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The back one for DSO is like the most important part.  
Fred Demargne: Exactly.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: So each so for each deal you associate multiple so it's a one to many  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get it.  
Fred Demargne: relationship between a deal or investment opportunity and a term sheet and then from the term sheet you derive everything  
   
 

### 02:17:39

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it is hierarchy.  
Fred Demargne: else.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is first deal and then multiple term sheets and from multiple term sheets have multiple fee models. Okay. Yeah, I will make this work. Um I have to edit this to make the fee plans.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And so when you Okay. Uh at what level of the business logic does does the fee plan or fee models edited for the subscript not subscription but for the introducer and  
Fred Demargne: Heat.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the partner? Is it when you dispatch it to them or is do you want to go to their profile and every time change it however you like?  
Fred Demargne: So you define the fee model for a particular for a particular term sheet before you dispatch to any introducer. When you dispatch the term sheet to an investor, you need to associate the introducer. And in the in the in the database data model, the the fee model is associated to a term sheet and to an introducer. So automatically the system associates a term sheet with an investor, with an introducer and with a fee model at the time of dispatch.  
   
 

### 02:19:05

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um the time of dispatch you have to select the fee model  
Fred Demargne: Yes. No,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: or the introducer.  
Fred Demargne: you have to select a term sheet. You have to select the investor and you have to select the introducer. And because the the fee model is associated to a term sheet and to an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,  
Fred Demargne: introducer, then the system works.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: let me think. Okay. Uh so when you dispatch the members, you have to select the term sheet, you have to select the investor, you have to select the fee plan. But when you create a fee plan, you already associate the introducer to it. Is that correct?  
Fred Demargne: when you create the the fee plan  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I'm just trying to  
Fred Demargne: you have you have you have associate here because introducer is to accept the fee  
Ghiles Moussaoui: understand.  
Fred Demargne: model.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's an agreement,  
Fred Demargne: So, so before so there are two dispatches.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right?  
Fred Demargne: Um, so the the the process is the following.  
   
 

### 02:20:37

   
Fred Demargne: You have a new investment opportunity. You create a term sheet and you say, "Okay, I'd like to uh um speak to my introducer so that they see if that client could be interested to to formalize that conversation. I need to dispatch a fee model to the introducer. The introducer has a possibility to accept it or not to accept it. As soon as he accepts it, he means that the fee model is definitely associated to the introducer for that particular investment opportunity and that particular term sheet. So that's one part of it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: So then the introducer introduce the investor and then we are able to do the dispatch of the term sheet to the investor and here we need to also  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: associate the introducer to that dispatch. So because the introducer previously to that dispatch to the investor was associated to a female and to a term sheet and one when you dispatch the same term sheet to an investor associating the the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: introducer then the system automatically is linked to the fee models that was approved by the introducer.  
   
 

### 02:22:02

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um, got it. And okay, so the action, the sequence of actions is okay, you create a deal, you put a term sheet in there, maybe one, maybe multiple, you publish some uh of them, and you add you dispatch it to investor. Investor only cares about term sheet. They see term sheet. But when you dispatch it, you don't dispatch it to introducer, but you go create a fee plan. When you create that fee plan, uh you put the numbers manually but accordingly to the term sheet and you can add introducer there. Uh you could dispatch the female to introducer which is an agreement which will create the agreement send it and once once there is signature done and then you can go and dispatch the introducer to a specific investor. Um so then there is the deal level and then there is the term sheet level which is connected to the fee model the agreement that introducer signed and the investor that only cares about the term sheet. Is that correct?  
Fred Demargne: Can you repeat the last sentence, the last part?  
   
 

### 02:23:27

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um at the end you will have fee model that is extracted from a specific term sheet that the investor so  
Fred Demargne: Mhm.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: investor cares only about what is mentioned inside the term sheet the introducer his  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: commission is coming from the fee model that is coming from the term sheet that the investor is responsible for. So they pay the term sheet term sheet um creates a fee model. The investor gets a commission for from the fee model and when the investor when the introducer is connected to the investor then the commission works is created. Is that correct?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And when  
Fred Demargne: I mean then the payment the payment flow can be initiated but  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. It's a  
Fred Demargne: the the the actual agreement is in place as soon as the introducer has  
Ghiles Moussaoui: connection.  
Fred Demargne: agreed with uh the in the the uh the female but then it effectively kicks in when uh When the dispatch to the investor is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
   
 

### 02:24:34

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: And also uh the money only happens via stages after the position  
Fred Demargne: done  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is created and subscription is active and investment is active. Is that correct? You which means you only the investor only sees that the ability to input an invoice in once the subscription is fully funded or partially funded.  
Fred Demargne: fully funded.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, got it. And is that the same workflow with the  
Fred Demargne: the same as a it shouldn't be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: partner?  
Fred Demargne: when the it should be when the opportunity is closed. It's at the closing that we should we should in we should request the invoice from the introducer or from the partner. It's not when the subscription is fully funded. is actually when the opportunity is closed. So that's why the closing date is kind of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: important.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will change this in the system  
Fred Demargne: But you you will understand when I when I send you the term the the the full  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and  
Fred Demargne: template for a term sheet because I think I think the closing date is very important.  
   
 

### 02:25:46

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: It's not only a detail. It's it's I need to ask Julian why he shared with you this um this temp sheet. Maybe he had something in mind but uh because the one he shared with you is a very specific to a specific deal. Uh and maybe because he wants to do it like this now. So I need to have a conversation with him.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. Um, but partner they they have the ability to share the deal with investors. But how does it work? Is they are they connected to investors?  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you connect them to investors? And what is the also hierarchy of actions for partners and  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So the uh effectively the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: partners?  
Fred Demargne: um uh the the partner the investor needs to be associated to the partners. So normally this should be done uh the same way as an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: introducer.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: But um what I understand is that the introducer the moment you associate it for them the commission is uh started or like it's a starting point it's like an official point that  
   
 

### 02:27:08

   
Fred Demargne: The same  
Ghiles Moussaoui: now you but partner from the term sheet I got the share  
Fred Demargne: partner.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: a deal with investor. So when you dispatch it to investor, when you connect the partner to an investor, you still um the partner still has to kind of refer it to the investor and investor can accept or how does it go?  
Fred Demargne: So it's the same as an introducer. So you before you dispatch to any investor the partner uh needs to agree on a fee model.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, so it's the same.  
Fred Demargne: This fee model is linked to a particular term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it  
Fred Demargne: There's not there's just not an agreement.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the  
Fred Demargne: We don't need to we don't formalize it with an agreement but there is still a fee models between a partner and a term sheet within an investment opportunity.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So then at the time of dispatch to the investor this time you need  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: to dispatch a term sheet to an investor to a partner.  
   
 

### 02:28:14

   
Fred Demargne: So here you associate both the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: both.  
Fred Demargne: uh investor to the term sheet and the partner to the investor for that particular deal.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: And because a partner has agreed on the female associated to the same term sheet that it's all related for the reconciliation.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And so what is the difference between introducer and  
Fred Demargne: The only difference is we don't form I mean a partner is like I am a part I am an equity partner in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: partner?  
Fred Demargne: Verso. Uh Julian is also an equity partner in Verso. We have another one, Dan is an equity partner in Verso. Uh so we don't need to formalize an agreement because a partner has uh you know a direct interest in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So  
Fred Demargne: um in Verso. But then the fee model is exactly the same. The reconciliation is exactly the same as you will need to do for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. So here what I extracted from the user if you see my screen I have partner persona  
   
 

### 02:29:26

   
Fred Demargne: introducer.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: business development partner who can also invest personally. So first partner view dispatched opportunity share deals with investors this unique capability uh track investor progress through funnel view commission fee tracking submit invoices for fees and this is just investor. So this share ability share deals with the investors is completely  
Fred Demargne: No, that's what we want to do.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: wrong.  
Fred Demargne: But uh uh what we realize to simplify the process.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should I remove it or leave it?  
Fred Demargne: No, you can you can leave it because that's the ultimately the ambition that we have.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: uh but uh to implement that functionality which is different than the rest is it's it's additional  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Internet went off.  
Fred Demargne: work and I don't think it's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I cannot hear you.  
Fred Demargne: trivial.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I couldn't hear you in the last 5 seconds. Internet went  
Fred Demargne: I say when we when we had planned the work,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: down.  
Fred Demargne: we still want to be able to do this. uh but because it was not trivial to do this this capability this  
   
 

### 02:30:44

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: functionality then what we had decided is to make it similar to uh an introducer so that the CEO  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: will link everything in the platform but the partner see the term sheet the introducer doesn't see the term sheet so the partner has all the information  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: to be able to share a deal with an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. This is one thing I was about to say.  
Fred Demargne: investor.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the investment opportunity page specifically. So it is for investor the last time we reviewed it we added the data room there but for other personas which I don't understand I thought okay for in introducer they also see the term sheet because I didn't see it in the user stories that they cannot see the term sheet they see the overview the term sheet but they don't see their fee model so this has to be changed into they see you know them seeing their fee model partner sees the term sheet and their fee model in an opportunity page And and what about uh the data  
   
 

### 02:31:53

   
Fred Demargne: Yes. Well, normally it was not supposed to be the same page. It was supposed to be the page of normally the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: room?  
Fred Demargne: investment the investment opportunity page was to be was supposed to be the same for whoever persona has access to it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So what?  
Fred Demargne: And then when you are a partner you have a different view of the investment opportunity where you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: also link with investors your investors. So that that was the idea. So not to create a specific page of investment opportunity for different persona. The view investment opportunity will be the same for whoever has access to it which is the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I  
Fred Demargne: arranger  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think most of them have uh have access to investment opportunities  
Fred Demargne: CEO.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um through the investment pipeline but they have components high persona which means if you go in investment opport opportunities and you're an investor, you see specific things and and all of those change when you change a persona to you know if um a lawyer goes  
   
 

### 02:33:05

   
Fred Demargne: Yeah, know it's true.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: there.  
Fred Demargne: The term sheet was supposed to be hidden for the introducer.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So I will just hide  
Fred Demargne: And then uh and data room access.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.  
Fred Demargne: Normally you are not supposed as an introducer to get access data  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So I will remove it.  
Fred Demargne: room.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um what about the lawyer and commercial partner and who has access to data room directly and who requires granting access for investor? I understand they have to sign the NDA. Uh but what about the others for example lawyer or was a partner partner and introducer. So introducer has to have access um  
Fred Demargne: So yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah has access uh  
Fred Demargne: introduc partner has access.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: with how how does it work for them?  
Fred Demargne: Uh I think for the moment we can request an NDA that's not a big deal. We can have a similar process as an investor. the aranger um you know the aranger  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
   
 

### 02:34:06

   
Fred Demargne: doesn't doesn't need to sign an NDA so it's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: automatic  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The moment they are dispatched to that vehicle where all of the deals are, they have access to everything inside that  
Fred Demargne: why there's no dispatch to aringer the when you create an an a vehicle with an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: deal.  
Fred Demargne: investment opportunity in it you need to define who is the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, for now it's defined on the vehicle level.  
Fred Demargne: aranger  
Ghiles Moussaoui: We overviewed it. So when you create a series right you uh you put the arranger of that series there and then everything that is created they have access to it because it's hierarchy.  
Fred Demargne: exactly exactly exactly. Uh when it comes to the lawyer,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: uh I don't remember what we said for the lawyer. Um let me see the user stories mobile here for the lawyer. No for the lawyer we didn't it was hidden. There was no possibility to ask to get access to it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So no data rooms  
   
 

### 02:35:28

   
Fred Demargne: If he's connected as a lawyer,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: no. If the lawyer wants to invest, then yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: But we said the lawyer cannot invest with his login of a lawyer.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: No. No. There was if you look at the user story,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: there is no there is no request that access whatsoever.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So it's like an introducer in that  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.  
Fred Demargne: sense.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um commercial partner. We didn't  
Fred Demargne: All right. So commercial partner is a bit specific. Uh what did I  
Ghiles Moussaoui: really  
Fred Demargne: put? Yeah, commercial partner has access. So commercial partner it will need to sign an NDA.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: like the others. Okay, got it.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh so that is clear.  
Fred Demargne: And partner I'm just checking what we had defined. Yeah partner we said the same thing.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I have to sign NDA.  
Fred Demargne: Yes, that's what I told you.  
   
 

### 02:36:49

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: But I'm just taking in the in the um I know it's my  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Use your stories.  
Fred Demargne: opportunity as an investor and my investment view my transaction. Yeah. So there is a comment in the partner user story. So I want to display the list of opportunity I was notified to as a partner access room only if NDA signed. So yeah you need to sign  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: NDA  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, what we still have to cover uh yeah the for testing when you go create the personas um accounts I think there will be some changes um I don't know what fields the fields of the database you can see a lot them created uh based on either what Julian shared with me the examples or something general. When you go to users  
Fred Demargne: I don't know. We need to be more specific. What you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Let me go to a specific user  
Fred Demargne: mean?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: here. So this is an investor.  
   
 

### 02:38:31

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: They just have legal name, display name, type, individual entity, email, phone number, country, country, country of incorporation, tax system, and what else? Uh relationship manager, but this is not useful. Um yeah, I will add uh producers and partners here. portal  
Fred Demargne: So you so you need um Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: users.  
Fred Demargne: So you need all the fields. U  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Is there anything specific to a persona that the other persona doesn't have?  
Fred Demargne: no they all the persona all the user needs to provide the same information.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And when you create it because  
Fred Demargne: So I need to add this action for me in um I need to send you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: um so how should I call it a user field?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah, schema for accounts for persona accounts.  
Fred Demargne: How do you call this? Kapa.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Schema uh database  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Shima. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: schema.  
Fred Demargne: Um user account fields I'll put confirmation.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
   
 

### 02:39:55

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: And because these will also be used when you  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: create document automatically DNA sorry NDI subscription pack agreements they use the address or maybe the email or maybe the name the specific information of each user that are involved in that document but yeah. Okay. Um, so lawyer investor we went through this business persona deal to investment. Um, should we go through it? Do you have time or do you prefer to ask me some questions and we work with what we have right now? I still I'm testing this. I will change this document to um with what you told me about the fees a lot of the fees and the relationship and I will you know change what needs to be changed build it uh change the processes map and test uh again process by process. I know first the creation works and what works before works. But now I need to test stage by stage all of the processes like uh co creates deals. Uh s creates vehicle uh creates term sheet with with terms creates fee plan for um for the deal.  
   
 

### 02:41:35

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Assign partners and introducer to deal. Upload data and do documents. Opportunity dispatch your dispatches to investors. Dispatch to group investor to partners with fee models to introducer with agreement to commercial partners. Commercial partners agreement dispatch placement agreement dispatched can subscribe on behalf of clients. NA interest investor receives opportunity notification optional and path status update. No further. Uh option two interested in investor dare recourse created NDA require required for exit data auto generated investor digitally signed the room access 7 day. They can can request extension if needed subscription investor confirms interest with amount co generate subscription pack automatically via an approval pling through subscription agreement. Signed letter signed letter I don't know power of I don't know about this term of and conditions pack dispatch to investor investor reviews pack can donate documents can add comments questions can request changes if changes needed update subscription pack send investor approves pack digitally signature investor signs the document all of the signatories on the entity level sign document CEO O arranger counter sign automatically when it's generated.  
   
 

### 02:43:09

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Lawyer notified of completion. Um funding post signature funding request sent. Investor transfers funds to escrow account. Bank transaction received import or via API. Reconciliations process. Auto match or manual match for trans. Yeah. Description amount verification extra confirmed. Offer arrange refund. Enter. Request additional uh funding confirmed. Subscription status updates to funded position is created for portfolio. Fee payment workflow triggered. Uh partner fee calculated. Introducer. So this changes when the deal is closed. It's not when portfolio is active.  
Fred Demargne: Uh when the when the Yeah, this I need to check with Julian when it should be when the deal is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: closed.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it. Yeah. Let me know. Certificate issuance funding certificate generation co generates equity certificate lawyer signature spiceman inserted. CEO approves for dispatch. Certificate sent to investor. Statement of holdings generated. Uh statements of holding is same as a certificate.  
   
 

### 02:44:41

   
Fred Demargne: is the same. Yes, we unified it to one document.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Got it. Fee payments. Fee calculations. Partner fee. CO notifies partner to submit invoice. Partner submits invoicing platform. Your arranger requests payment to lawyer. Lawyer process payments from Iscro. Partner notified of payment. Introducer fees. Same workflow as partner based on introduction agreement terms. Commercial partner based on placement agreement maybe per client uh or aggregate. Okay. And this is cross persona interaction matrix. Yeah, I think this just a consequence notifications. It's clear keyword for by phase. Uh should we go through this? The workflows by phase. Sorry.  
Fred Demargne: User on boarding um sent complete profile submit KYC pros You are missing the you are missing  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, we see  
Fred Demargne: the um compliance questionnaire.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is done for investor.  
Fred Demargne: This is done for investor. Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: you need to add um I mean once we have the KYC then we consider that the do the the investor has is is able to access the portal.  
   
 

### 02:46:22

   
Fred Demargne: uh but we also need to ask for specifically for compliance questionnaire which is completely separate from submitting the KYC  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's done for now.  
Fred Demargne: documents  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I just didn't document it here. But it's only for investor.  
Fred Demargne: only for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: For other they don't have it.  
Fred Demargne: yeah and  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um, so we'll have to  
Fred Demargne: remember for lawyer uh he needs to be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: add  
Fred Demargne: approved But he doesn't need to submit a profile for approval. Okay. I don't know what you what you Okay. The same profile. Okay. Okay. Makes sense. Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: submit professor  
Fred Demargne: A lawyer the full portal access of a lawyer is different than from an investor because he cannot  
Ghiles Moussaoui: How come?  
Fred Demargne: invest.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And unless Yeah. Yes, that is true. But how uh what are the differences? Just see if I understand correctly because if  
Fred Demargne: The difference is when you see an investment I mean if you  
   
 

### 02:47:28

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: they  
Fred Demargne: um you will see that there is an investment opportunity as a lawyer because when you uh create the vehicle you will define the arranger as we discussed before but equally you will define the lawyer  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. So, it's on the vehicle level.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.  
Fred Demargne: Uh because those because a lawyer is defined as a lawyer then he should be able to see that there is an investment opportunity. He will not have access to the data room but you will see that there is an investment opportunity and then he should only get notifications once a pack is signed.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. All right. Um, yeah. Subscription pack life cycle. I think we went through this comment rejection ranger counter sign execute reconciliations. So with the reconciliations of when invest when lawyer is um they have to confirm the payments to the escro account.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, this is Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Well, refund process, I don't know. Uh, we don't automate this refund process.  
   
 

### 02:49:12

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, no problem.  
Fred Demargne: We we we we need to automate the under funding but the over funding we don't because  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's  
Fred Demargne: sometime it's uh so I don't know if you saw in the in the in the user stories um when there is a under in underfunding normally there is an approval by the CEO because sometime underfunded. Funding could be 30, could be the the banking  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it stops in reconciliations for now which COS has access to.  
Fred Demargne: fees.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Like when you ask for more money, there isn't any automation or something like that in the platform for now. if it's 30 euros or um yeah stop  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, I think we're going to need to have an agent for this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: reconiliations.  
Fred Demargne: Basically by the way in the action that we should uh in the notion I should add an action which is define the different agents.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, which Jordan wanted as  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: well.  
Fred Demargne: Julian is pretty adamant. He wants to have agents.  
   
 

### 02:50:29

   
Fred Demargne: So let me add an action for me this time. uh list of agents. Do you consider the audit uh tracking that we discussed as an agent?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um agents takes actions and is powered either via automation. So it's either programmatically uh designed or it takes decision like um an AI agent. So it has an LLM inside. So for now to be clear what is uh created are these mostly there is some inside the there is like 21 agents in the platform but it's chrome jobs so they are scheduled and they do specific tasks but there is um subscription pack is an agent it's an automation but you can name it an agent if you want NDA workflow uh there is reporting Um there is LinkedIn assistant scraper inbox manager. It was built for email. It has does three tasks. Reporting agent  
Fred Demargne: Do I have do I have access to this page or on N18 or not?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: no  
Fred Demargne: I think that would be great if you could give me access to it.  
   
 

### 02:51:50

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh  
Fred Demargne: I think I think for me the subscription pack is more an automation.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's an automation. Yeah, it is an automation.  
Fred Demargne: I think no I think you're just there is no you know you just there's a trigger a confirmation of interest you populate a document based on a template you generate this document and then you share it with you give it access to a user so for me I'm not sure I will call this an agent what do you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I keep it simple here. It's just it it receives the data. It uh gets the file that is a template. it. Let me check if I can get uh ah sorry zoomed in so we cannot weird but oh noifications. Yeah. So basically it gets the data via web hook gets the file. It downloads the file. It takes uh the raw data from here. It manually formats it. It uh uh yeah, this downloads um the document.  
Fred Demargne: Well, if you want to call it an agent.  
   
 

### 02:53:19

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh this no I  
Fred Demargne: I'm okay. I'm not gonna I don't want to fight with you. Uh I can call it an agent if you want.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: mean it's not for me it's for me  
Fred Demargne: So there's um agent there is active  
Ghiles Moussaoui: code  
Fred Demargne: agent that you have defined and then there is inactive at the moment and we have to decide whether we activate them or not. No.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah so okay so there is these let's say call them uh workflows right there is subscription pack workflow, NDA workflow. Um there is the reporting agent which does both public reporting and um public reporting which means it scrapes the web via perplexity API and there is corporate reporting which sends an email to responsible of people inside specific companies of series to provide specific documents on a quarterly, monthly and annually level. um and it waits for them. It stores it and then it triggers again to check if I think there's another workflow that triggers and checks if they provided the documents or no.  
   
 

### 02:54:29

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: we can check  
Fred Demargne: So that's data room uh data  
Ghiles Moussaoui: reports.  
Fred Demargne: room um recurring reporting from companies. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: How did you call those agents?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. Uh it's a reporting  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: agent.  
Fred Demargne: But the same those two things that you mentioned to me before is the same thing is the same name.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh which are two things.  
Fred Demargne: the reporting uh I mean reporting information from the public from the internet  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: on a specific company versus creating the triggers  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: to request an a representative of a company to provide us uh to provide us uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: with  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Wait, this uh has three workflows, right? There is an annually, monthly trigger and quarterly. And this gets information uh from a database, right? An an external database. For now, it's quarterly. This is quarterly, corporate and public and there is also quarterly um public only right um there isn't quarterly um corporate only either covered in public or public only from the database that J shared with me and based on that if it is corporate and public it will go get the data and then loop through it um loop through get uh so the messages uh the It sends a message with a template um gets a message ID and  
   
 

### 02:56:15

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: this manually schema thing stores it in the database. It waits a little bit and it does uh for all of the people for that specific quarter uh that necessitate a reporting but it's not done yet. And also it then goes to do the because it's also public. It does the scraping via perplexity. It gets information. It generates a report. It puts it as an HTML. It stores it inside um Google Drive. Um and then it creates a row. It stores the database or something that already has been done. And yeah, so same thing with monthly and yearly. And this one month uh weekly checks in. It checks the the messages that have been sent for public reporting and checks which one have answered and downloads all of the attachments that has been received and puts them inside uh the Yeah. So once it's downloaded, it puts them inside the uh where is it again? Yeah, the database uh and then it will send it also to the Google drive right as reporting has been done.  
   
 

### 02:57:41

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is for reporting. There is inbox manager. Um, this doesn't have it  
Fred Demargne: So but my question was my question without going into all the detail was this reporting agent is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: has  
Fred Demargne: doing two different in very different jobs.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: One is scrapping the internet for information on the company.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: two things.  
Fred Demargne: Another thing which is generating a workflow whereby we  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: request a representative of a company to provide us with an information on a quarterly, annually, monthly basis.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it does both.  
Fred Demargne: I think it would be better to have it as a separate agent.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's a um I don't know what changes for me when I created it. I put it in once because I thought okay this is reporting.  
Fred Demargne: Oh,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know what changes. What do you think? Because the the set of what is public, what is corporate, what is both is filtered in a database and on quarterly uh when it triggers it only gets what is that on that quarterly and uh if it is corporate and public it gets only that segment and so it does everything automatically based on a filter.  
   
 

### 02:59:00

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I can show you more in the database if you want. I mean, if you would like me to separate them, it's I don't think it changes anything, but I can do it as well. No problem.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I mean it's not critical for now but I think I think there should be two different agents. One is a market intelligence agent and one which is more about you know specifically  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: requesting companies um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Uh,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: inbox manager. This has been created for email. It was he. So, Julian told me three tasks that it has to do. So if an email is received, if it's sent by Julian to a specific email address where the agent manages it, it checks the subject if a subject is attachment or KYC list or new folder and based on that if it is attachment uh it sends a specific email that has attachments and it downloads the attachments. It puts them inside a specific folder.  
   
 

### 03:00:21

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know what this I created this. We started working on these in the beginning. We didn't um count it as platform. So I don't know if this is necessary anymore because it's KYC list but we have a platform for KYC and email. So yeah, we'll have to define this later on. And okay, reporting agent for um for outreach and scraping leads. Uh I have v scraper through sales le sales navigator connection request scraper followup LinkedIn connections um check LinkedIn connections yeah and there is these which is statement agent uh this generates I don't know if there is executions no I don't Yeah. So this generates document based on Yeah, it gets let me check. Yeah, this statements reports uh based on the investor, right? I think you select an investor and you select a deal or like a subscription or investment that's they invested or I think just an investor and you generate position statements for them.  
Fred Demargne: Okay, I need to review this I think in detail to if you if you can if you can just to help me if you can put in the canban board the list of agents that we  
   
 

### 03:02:36

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: have.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh and then I will confirm the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Some things need to be created like a KYC review um  
Fred Demargne: agents.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: automatic and things like that a compliance agent but it doesn't take much time to create the  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: agent.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So okay yeah makes  
Fred Demargne: It's just to have a list. So to have a list based on what already exists and then  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sense. So,  
Fred Demargne: uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: let me go. All right.  
Fred Demargne: Mhm.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: So I So you I Okay,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: so  
Fred Demargne: you created a new one. I had created one but it's okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: oh  
Fred Demargne: I will delete mine. Uh or you can leave this one will be uh I will change my action.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.  
Fred Demargne: I would say prioritization of agents for production for launch and then you have yours where you put  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,  
Fred Demargne: the list.  
   
 

### 03:04:15

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: good.  
Fred Demargne: Uh me I just have one question and I'm going to have to go because I've got other meetings.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: Um, if I go to if I want to create a you to invite a new user. So now I need to wait for you to tell me that the email works to be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah, I have it.  
Fred Demargne: able to test it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Do you think this will be done  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, of course.  
Fred Demargne: today?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me know what you need for tomorrow. Uh wait, build production  
Fred Demargne: I mean today what I would like is to test user accounts.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: plan.  
Fred Demargne: So all the user accounts  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, got it.  
Fred Demargne: flow.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh if you remember uh the schema I asked for if you could share that schema so we can integrate it and so when you create an account it's the schema that you want and so you can test it directly I think that makes sense and u yeah you can uh today  
   
 

### 03:05:06

   
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: creating users inviting them receiving the email works uh for each person and I think he need to work uh I will test the dispatching Today I will change the fe models um and basically make work what everything we talked about edit the process map and then start also uh making sure the process map works and yeah so if I go to canban I see subscription plans this will would be done today. User guides uh I think not today. User guides when do you need  
Fred Demargne: Oh, we need this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: them?  
Fred Demargne: I mean, ideally what I should do, for instance, I do the user account testing, the UAT testing for user account. Ideally,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: what I would love is that the the user guide for user account uh creation uh are finalized by the time I approve the UAE.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So if there is if there is still some detail which I need to fill up to make it to to finalize it,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: it's okay.  
   
 

### 03:06:30

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. It's a schema. That's all.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And  
Fred Demargne: So I'm going to send you I need to first send you the schema that you mentioned the field confirmation.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Then you need to be able to work on the user guide with this list of fields. And then once you've done the the the field when you've implemented the field confirmation and the email uh then I uh I can start the UAT for user account  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: creation.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Did I should I create user guide just after I'm done?  
Fred Demargne: I you organize the way you want whatever is more convenient for you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean for you because user guide is for you.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. for for me the user guide I'm telling you what what will be great is to have them ready by the time I finish the UAT testing of a particular block of functionalities  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: so here the first one I'm working on now is user account creation uh so  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
   
 

### 03:07:31

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can  
Fred Demargne: if we if you could work on this uh between today  
Ghiles Moussaoui: us  
Fred Demargne: tomorrow I don't know and then I will have some comments and I will probably finalize it myself because  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: I we don't have time to you know uh share comments on this so that you can add comments add the content that I'm expecting so I will probably enrich it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Correct. And for the user guides,  
Fred Demargne: myself  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh, do you want to categorize them by um by process or how does it specific user story or by process? A process is just a combination. How we went through this document is just a combination of user  
Fred Demargne: I think it needs to be more more straightforward.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: stories.  
Fred Demargne: It's really a user guide as I mentioned in the description that we could share to to clients.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: By persona. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So yeah, so it should be by persona probably. I mean although user account I think we should try to make it as simple as possible  
   
 

### 03:08:30

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.  
Fred Demargne: for across all persona.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: Uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: See another thing um the video  
Fred Demargne: yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: that Julian shared with me in the beginning or like the the when I showcase the demo I demo the platform in November. Do I still put it when somebody on boards  
Fred Demargne: Say it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the video?  
Fred Demargne: again.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, is it still something we want to have when somebody creates an account fresh and  
Fred Demargne: I have the on boarding  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sign?  
Fred Demargne: video.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: That's what Julian wants here. On boarding and just adding it in the production plan on boarding.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for  
Fred Demargne: But this we need to have um I think I'm going to ask Julian to work on this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: all  
Fred Demargne: But we need to have the final version of the platform to do that to do this  
Ghiles Moussaoui: to do what?  
Fred Demargne: video.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The video is already there.  
Fred Demargne: But how did you make the video if we don't if we haven't finished the the design?  
   
 

### 03:09:54

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, it's a pop-up video that opens when somebody is signed in for the first time. They watch the video, watch it. Once it's done, they click on done and it's never seen after. Julian shared with shared it with me. Let me see if I can find it. I think I don't know if you remember it.  
Fred Demargne: I don't know how you J made a video without showing the application platform.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. It was just uh Yeah, this one. Can you see my  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: screen? It's uh it's just show anything.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but this for me is not the video to show in the platform. It's a video that we need to display on the website or vers  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah,  
Fred Demargne: hotel,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it makes  
Fred Demargne: but it's not the video that was Gina was referring to where you basically wants to explain every  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sense.  
Fred Demargne: new user what they can do on the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand.  
Fred Demargne: application.  
   
 

### 03:11:09

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean this it was just for the demo I believe. This is why I asked.  
Fred Demargne: So, we're going to need to do some videos. And I think here for that we need to have the maybe Julian can Julian likes to do these kind of things.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh so I need I will ask him but I think now we need to just finalize the uh uh we need to finalize the the testing first. um onboarding videos uh to uh we just need to have in the onboarding process. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: I don't know if we want to do it before the profile is created or after the profile is created, but we need to display some video or one  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: video once  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is profile creation specifically?  
Fred Demargne: the profile is approved.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: But what is approved? Uh is it the KYC?  
Fred Demargne: By the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is specifically? Because now when you go to users, create an account, right?  
   
 

### 03:12:30

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can put all of the information of the investor that you want and when you invite them, they log in and they can go to their profile, but it's not onboarding uh to account creation because they already have an account.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. What what I meant is should we do it should we display those video before the profile is approved by the CEO? So after they provided their profile information, their KYC documents or should we display this video after they just create their  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think when they log in for the first time,  
Fred Demargne: password.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's uh more I think it makes more sense.  
Fred Demargne: Okay, makes sense. Um, we need to have a checklist for the production plan. Uh I need to work on this. Uh so there is a video that needs to be ready.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: There is a list of agents Julian wants to have implemented. There is we need to have an agent to verify uh the data consistency.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh  
Fred Demargne: So we need to have a batch we need to have a batch of data.  
   
 

### 03:13:44

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: complete.  
Fred Demargne: I don't know how you want to do it uh in the production environment.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: uh this we can automate it but I think then we need to have an agent who needs to verify the data consistency but to make sure that  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So what is data consistency for  
Fred Demargne: the data makes sense between so the names so the names of the investor are correctly  
Ghiles Moussaoui: you?  
Fred Demargne: recorded in the names when there is an entity there is only one name when there is a an individual there is a first name and the last name um to make sure that for each user I mean how we going to do for the email  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You want to  
Fred Demargne: addresses  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh we I think the problem is that there is a lot to put at in one one place right so if I just have a source can use an agent to batch everything create a staging environment and put everything in database and then invite everybody through their emails because in the dashboard I don't see no emails if you can see my screen and I also don't know where to find the introducers and partners here.  
   
 

### 03:15:23

   
Fred Demargne: on the on the on the left on the right. Sorry. On the right hand side because Julian took it out from you. How did you get this uh document?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Julian share with  
Fred Demargne: Uh yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: me.  
Fred Demargne: So he didn't um he he so he he shared the document on the drive or he he sent you uh by by email.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think both uh he showed it. Yeah, I think both in drive and also let me just check. No, my drive. Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: So click on it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: holder.  
Fred Demargne: So click on one of the link, one of the tabs. This one is not a good one. Click on VC3 for instance and go on the right. Yeah, you see you have more information in here. You have the introducer. You have the names of the partners. You have the names of the introducers. The fees  
Ghiles Moussaoui: where oh name this so  
Fred Demargne: associated  
Ghiles Moussaoui: these but they don't understand uh okay who Who is an injured?  
   
 

### 03:16:59

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Versus holdings partners. Uh okay. Okay. I didn't see these and when I I worked I also only worked on these. Okay. I will extract the data. And how do I map um name and email  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: later?  
Fred Demargne: that's uh you need to have an agent to scrap uh Jian's contact list.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And where do I Okay, the contact list has their name, right? And email. If it's the same name. Uh, okay. It makes sense.  
Fred Demargne: We're going to need to we you're going to need to try to launch an agent to match and then we're going to need to to verify it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Verify. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there any specific uh rules? Um especially sometimes there is negative amounts and sometimes there is a zero amounts. So, do I just use everything or or do I is there specific rules for when I find something negative because it was used to pay um or like Yeah, it was used to pay someone in stocks or as an investor.  
   
 

### 03:18:51

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know if you can understand me.  
Fred Demargne: So you need to look at the data the at the document in detail and maybe ask me for questions.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,  
Fred Demargne: Um yeah just I want to make a reference.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is the  
Fred Demargne: If you look at the row 31, you see that you have icing in the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry, what is it?  
Fred Demargne: column P row 31 column P you have is. So when you see it means that we need to exclude this from  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: the from the first batch.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And the amounts. Um, is the summary accurate?  
Fred Demargne: What is uh accurate? Uh the summary is a link to if every single tab.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: summary.  
Fred Demargne: So that should be unless there is a mistake in the I mean it hasn't been updated for some time  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So what I mean is once I sum everything uh with the other because I'll try this  
Fred Demargne: now.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: with the agent to make sure everything is correct.  
   
 

### 03:20:21

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will sum everything with from VC1 until VC the last one and if I don't find the same amount which means there is a mistake.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So I will I will investigate. So you make the program to check.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: When you see a gap, you tell me and I will have to manually double  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: check.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this I believe is kind of the last things um we have to do, right? Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Um, yeah, I think it makes sense.  
Fred Demargne: So investments  
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you have anything else, if anyone include anything else, let me  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: know.  
Fred Demargne: I'm just putting some comments in the production plan. So you need to look at it. Um um so onboarding videos after first login list of agents to be uh defined and there's another action for another task for the list of agents that you need to provide me with batches of data in a production envir batches of data in a production environment.  
   
 

### 03:21:38

   
Fred Demargne: So we need to define the process So it's from the dashboard uh for for the investment uh for investor names, partners, introducers. We are missing the lawyers in the dashboard. you don't know um all investment opportunities or vehicles have uh Verso Management Limited as our Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And what about commercial partners?  
Fred Demargne: Commercial partners too.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: But I think there isn't many,  
Fred Demargne: well the commercial partners no  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? four years as well.  
Fred Demargne: but  
Ghiles Moussaoui: If I remember correctly, I need  
Fred Demargne: so Julian just I was also sending messages from Julian to Julian regarding what we discussed before uh on the triggers for the confirming the position and for the invoices. is of the partners and introducers  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: and he has confirmed to me eventually. I think in the beginning he was not understanding and I just confirmed to me that it should be linked to the closing both the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: closing date.  
Fred Demargne: uh issuance of the certificate and and  
   
 

### 03:23:30

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Even the certificate.  
Fred Demargne: the request of uh the invoices.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. But uh say a subscription is active. If it's fully funded, they will not see the  
Fred Demargne: No, we need to have the closing. Once the closing is done,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: certificate.  
Fred Demargne: that he means that we the issuer, the CEO can confirm the position because you know it could happen that we get the money and we have to return the funds to the investors because we haven't been able to do the closing. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Closing. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: so we need the the the fact that we receive the funds is not always enough for us to say this is done. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got  
Fred Demargne: we need to receive the money and we need to receive a confirmation from um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.  
Fred Demargne: the the the the investor that we are sourcing uh the shares that everything is in order. Once the closing is done, then we have received the money. We have received confirmation that we have the shares.  
   
 

### 03:24:43

   
Fred Demargne: So we can confirm to the investor that he has he has a number of shares corresponding to this money.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And what is the  
Fred Demargne: So so we can so here this is when this is what I what we call the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: action?  
Fred Demargne: closing.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And what is the action? Is it the close date or closing of the deal?  
Fred Demargne: It should be it should be uh I mean I think that normally is a closing date. Uh that should be but um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there an approval for the CEO?  
Fred Demargne: yeah there should be an approval for the CEO.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh  
Fred Demargne: So we should trigger a closing date uh uh confirmation by the CEO.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. So on closing date an approval will be triggered and created for the CEO. Once that approval is agreed upon then the portfolio is created and a certificate is created and sent to the investor. Is that correct?  
Fred Demargne: And the invoices are requested by the aranger to the introducer partners and so  
   
 

### 03:25:44

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Will they will see the ability to put an invoice.  
Fred Demargne: on.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: That makes sense. So we'll work on that today. Hopefully we'll get all of that done. Anything else  
Fred Demargne: Now I'm just writing the production plan back to H. So list of agents there is a list of avatar that J wants to use for the agents.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: for the agents? Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh so the batch of data. So I was mentioning the dashboard for some of it. So, we're going to need to scrap a joant contact list to get all the emails and the names. Uh, he's okay. He said he sent to me. He was okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So, um, user names, email. The complexity here is we need to associate each user to their entity. So, they're going to need to we're going to need to make some  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Well, yeah, true.  
Fred Demargne: checks.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: That's the what I'm thinking of because so here in the dashboard we do have the type of investor investor entity investor first name and entity.  
   
 

### 03:27:16

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: If entity is not uh is not provided it means they are individual. Is that correct?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, that's what you should do as an assumption to to to automate this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: And then I will need to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And um for the users they I  
Fred Demargne: check.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: just need one email address right like one email per individual  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: or also per per uh  
Fred Demargne: not per individual.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: entity.  
Fred Demargne: So you have an email per individual and each individual is associated to an entity or  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Um but when it is individual there is only one email address.  
Fred Demargne: not.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: when it is entity. Is it possible that Julian has multiple email addresses for an entity for like multiple individuals inside an  
Fred Demargne: You know Julian will have only users in under each user he might have  
Ghiles Moussaoui: entity?  
Fred Demargne: he should have the reference to the company they are working for.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So then we need to gather all the users with each of them as one email  
   
 

### 03:28:19

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get it.  
Fred Demargne: address.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh we should link those user to the entity they belong to. So there is not one email per entity.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: There is one email per user and you have multiple users per entity.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, that's correct.  
Fred Demargne: Um, a question for the introducer. Uh should we gather introducer? Uh we should gather what they were paid and this we need to do it from the escore account.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: There we go.  
Fred Demargne: If we have the if we want to have the history of what the introducer uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think the data will take some time especially if there is uh  
Fred Demargne: received.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: spec like special cases in the data in the sheet I'm not sure and the introducer how do we map it to escrow  
Fred Demargne: And we have the escro account extractions. So we can check the names the amount and I have I've made the I've make I always make a reconciliation with a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah.  
   
 

### 03:30:06

   
Fred Demargne: vehicle. So the banking extraction includes a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: vehicle.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And uh another thing  
Fred Demargne: What is more,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is  
Fred Demargne: what we're going to need to check is um the association between association between investors and partners/introducers. This is from the dashboard, but we're going to need to check to to to double  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I think I would create everything inside the um Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: check.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And then we can select which one we invite with the ones that are we that we checked we are sure of their data. We can start inviting them batches by batch.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And I think last time I checked the dashboard, I found um 400 70 something investors.  
Fred Demargne: I think there's more.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. There is al also name like different names. Uh Julian for example. Uh there is G uh Mashot I believe and his entire name.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, it's it's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: perfect.  
   
 

### 03:31:50

   
Fred Demargne: No, no, it's Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.  
Fred Demargne: it's um uh it's it's not ideal. It's complicated.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So we have to map by the name  
Fred Demargne: or the entity name. Yeah, because the problem is in the dashboard I didn't have the name of the of the users. So I only have the entity names.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I  
Fred Demargne: Then we need to link the entity names with a user who belongs to the entity from  
Ghiles Moussaoui: think  
Fred Demargne: Julian contact list.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: so. Yeah. Okay. Uh okay. So yeah the from the contact list we will have either one email for the user or the entity. So the rules are I think simple here where you can okay if there is no username but there is entity and the email address is related to the entity then you can just invite a person from the entity you know you put  
Fred Demargne: No, you you will not you will never invite an entity.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the  
Fred Demargne: You will invite users and the entity can invest once all the user have been approved.  
   
 

### 03:33:02

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: You don't you don't invite company A.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: But  
Fred Demargne: You invite users who belong to company A.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: And each user needs to be approved. Each signature user needs to be approved for the entity to be able to invest.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, this is the a new rule I didn't uh I wasn't aware of. I thought the they invite members um an admin member of a company so to say can invite members and put them as signatories. But there wasn't an approval for the CEO. So, you want me to add me to add an approval section?  
Fred Demargne: Now each each user needs to be approved by the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. So,  
Fred Demargne: CEO.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: both KYC wise and uh so what does the COC to approve it? Is it KYC or is it just the name and contain information?  
Fred Demargne: both both here we need to get KYC of the entity  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. All right. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: as well that one of the user doesn't matter which one needs to provide the KYC of the  
   
 

### 03:34:07

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. KY entity has to be done and uh each member has their own KYC that needs to be  
Fred Demargne: entity  
Ghiles Moussaoui: done so they can invest.  
Fred Demargne: okay well listen I think we going I'm going need to go I think we've done a lot today uh Uh we've got  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, for sure.  
Fred Demargne: lots of actions but you need to finalize stuff.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh I'll try to get back to you. So I think in terms of priority there is a user account field confirmation and I need to provide you with today and a template. Uh I think that's uh the most critical piece. I don't know if I can add uh in the canban board if I can add priority. Let me see. No, I just put it on the top. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got  
Fred Demargne: On my uh on my uh on my canvan I put it on the top in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.  
Fred Demargne: in development. So I need to finish what is on the top.  
   
 

### 03:35:20

   
Fred Demargne: Um and then there's actions for you. I don't know if there are if you agree with the order of the actions in uh to start not started. We need to we just need to make sure that we we make it by order of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: to start in development.  
Fred Demargne: priority.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Start it uh subscription plans. This is simple user guides. Um user guys is after you test you need to have it priorization agents uh just yeah I mean this I will  
Fred Demargne: I think I need to put it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: get it all by today user guides I don't know because uh do you want screenshots as well or is just process explanation of how the user goes and does  
Fred Demargne: at some We're going to need to have screenshots,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: things.  
Fred Demargne: but I think we cannot have the screenshots until we finalize  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: that's the thing right we have to finalize also the processes. So one by one  
Fred Demargne: So, I think what I think we need to do is uh you need to have a  
   
 

### 03:36:28

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: um  
Fred Demargne: placeholder uh of the screenshots and then we will make the screenshot either you or me or we will split the work once the final version is ready.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah I think um I don't know if I can do it automatically with the browser automation. I will see if I can. It would be great to just do it automatically to also take screenshots automatically. Okay. So yeah, everything except uh user guides um I can guarantee for  
Fred Demargne: Well,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: today and okay this credentials. Yes,  
Fred Demargne: heat  
Ghiles Moussaoui: invite you. And a couple of more things I have in mind to test and change today.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I think it's in order. Every action is every task is is assigned to somebody. So I think we're good.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: And it would be good if you can put your action as well in into engineering the one which you have  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: specific to you so that we have a visibility on  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: everything.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: We'll work with it today.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.
