Fred Demargne: it's true it's true so I need to do it yeah I need to do it okay so it should be assigned to me now that you've done I should be in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, if you go.

Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I think you will find it in process fee process dispatching entity fields in done in development engineering entity fields have added it.  
   
 

### 00:05:05

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh there is one thing missing I documented there. It's about 90 95% done. Uh so at this date um what I've done as well  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is there was an issue  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: with  
Fred Demargne: you you you've done it and you tested it or you've or you've just implemented  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh done it and tested it but automatically.  
Fred Demargne: it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I still have to do it a little bit more manually to make sure.  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: can you leave it? Can you leave it in and um under testing so that  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sure. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I I know because otherwise I feel like I can start testing and and I believe  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: from what you just said it's not yet the case.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Testing.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the fields you will find them under profile for each entity their profile page uh because they will be able to edit them uh for users their own metadata and also the data of the entire entity.  
   
 

### 00:06:10

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um and also when you go to users under CEO you will find the um all of the feeds that we have added you will need to edit them or have the ability to edit them from there.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Um there was uh some issue I  
Fred Demargne: Um, that's cool. What else?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: detect.  
Fred Demargne: uh we can discuss this the subscription plans for production. So you put one thing for the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah because um I think we have everything else.  
Fred Demargne: moment.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: We have N8N already. We have Versal. Yeah I think there isn't anything else that is needed for now only.  
Fred Demargne: We don't need um we don't need um a cloud subscription.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh no, we're we're using Versal to deploy it. Uh we don't need AWS or anything like that for now. Everything runs in notion. Um sorry, in versal. And in case we need cloud, I have a server in uh hosing I I got for Verso couple of months ago.  
   
 

### 00:07:25

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So that does the job as well.  
Fred Demargne: Are you sure it's secure to keep it under Verso under the under the Google  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Google Cloud.  
Fred Demargne: cloud?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you mean?  
Fred Demargne: I mean the the code itself doesn't run on  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: verse.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The code is uh is deploying in Versel. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Ah vers uh so here but you are so you are paying for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's a pro account. You have uh Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: Is it secure? Is it secure  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's a known thing for NexJS framework.  
Fred Demargne: enough?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Everybody uses Versel.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, let maybe let's let's just put it into even though it's paid,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: let's just mention it in a notion.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Versel Pro.  
Fred Demargne: Um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: so paid for you can put it's already paid it's paid forever or you you are paying it for the monthly  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh, yeah, it's monthly  
   
 

### 00:08:33

   
Fred Demargne: basis.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: basis.  
Fred Demargne: So you but you are you are you are recharging it to to us. No.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So, if you can put the amount and just say um recharged or something, but put the amount. So, we have the uh we have all of these documented ones and for good. I think we mentioned yesterday that uh maybe more for me because you already have an account, but I need to have an account include and I need to pay for it because I  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: need to be I'm going to be able to um ask questions  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: directly into the into the code.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So, I think this is going to be needed. Um I'm going to see if I can do it today or tomorrow.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I think I will. I'm not sure but know the potentiality that I will buy another account because I need it and my weekly usage will soon be done. So, if I get another account, I will give you access to that instead of you getting a new one.  
   
 

### 00:09:46

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, and you will be able to do everything with it as well.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So ju just just mention it so that we have this in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So,  
Fred Demargne: mind  
Ghiles Moussaoui: should I put it in in development or not started?  
Fred Demargne: and we're going to still use it for pro I mean yeah put put it uh yeah put it in reviewing because you are currently reviewing it and then once you have the final list then I think we just need to uh to pay for it. So, super base uh I'll ask to Julian. And so, Clude, do you prefer to pay it yourself and recharge us or you prefer that we pay  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh as you want.  
Fred Demargne: directly?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I just told you that I strongly probably will get a cloud account.  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: you will have a second account for CL.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: And because with the unlimited the plan you have is not  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I got the maximum one.  
   
 

### 00:10:55

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: But there is um the API key.  
Fred Demargne: enough.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can pay per usage, but it's very expensive. For the 200 plan I pay, you get about 25,500 of usage of real uh of the model usage. Uh so it's better to buy the subscription than to use um you know pay as you go.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So there  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, yeah, if you have um if you I can speak with Julian,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: but um if he wants to have it on the vers, it doesn't matter.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I get it. Yeah. I think if you use it for work,  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's a very good investment as well. I just find the best um plan for it. Uh there is three. So yeah. Okay. So I asked a question somewhere yesterday. Yeah. Question to Fred  
Fred Demargne: Well,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and  
Fred Demargne: maybe let me should I um should I uh first go through the template?  
   
 

### 00:12:12

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: You  
Fred Demargne: Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sure?  
Fred Demargne: so yeah, because I haven't finished yet, but Julian just reconfirmed to me something this morning. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see my screen?  
Fred Demargne: I am on multiple screen. Yeah, now I can see your screen. Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh, let's wait. So, which template should we? Yeah. So, this one is I think Julian reconfirmed because I asked him just in case, but I was pretty clear on this one. I just going to check what he said. Uh, certificate use. So, which one did I send you? The title or  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh so you sent me equity certificate sentence the holding and the NDA sorry the the name of the file.  
Fred Demargne: the title of the file? Yeah. So I think that's good. Yeah. VC 209. I think that's what J confirmed to me. Yeah. So that will be the template for the certificate.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: correct?  
   
 

### 00:13:22

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is always these two  
Fred Demargne: Do you have any  
Ghiles Moussaoui: signatures.  
Fred Demargne: what did you say? I don't know. The signal was not good. So I didn't hear.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh is it always these two signatures? Okay. And what I need to know is what changes.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this obviously virtual capital 2  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, let me let me prepare it so that you don't guess it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and  
Fred Demargne: Let me open file on my side. Um I'm going to make it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah  
Fred Demargne: um up. I'm going to change the name so that we keep it as a template.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure.  
Fred Demargne: Um in the title I will put XX one days changes up. So preamble is so those document needs to be uh downloadable uh name of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: No.  
Fred Demargne: investor. Okay, let me share my screen so that I'll do it while you see it. It's going to be easier.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:14:57

   
Fred Demargne: and I will resend you the document with all the things in uh uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. All right.  
Fred Demargne: this let me know when you see my  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I do.  
Fred Demargne: screen okay so here the logo is I don't know if you have set up a logo because we have different uh vehicle with different branding So here that's the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: logo of the uh vehicle.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. Wait, what is the look of the vehicle?  
Fred Demargne: So I'll put in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there  
Fred Demargne: so whenever you are we are rever whenever we are referring to virtual  
Ghiles Moussaoui: something?  
Fred Demargne: capital to SCSP this is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: vers you have other we have  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Good.  
Fred Demargne: other vehicle that we haven't worked on yet which is not  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: person.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Good. What else?  
Fred Demargne: Um so here this is the series  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I I know about that.  
Fred Demargne: code.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The ch I don't know what um  
Fred Demargne: SH is uh is fixed and this is a  
   
 

### 00:16:20

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: ch  
Fred Demargne: unique um index of the investment investor investor slash investment because you could have you could have uh one investor investing multiple time multiple times in the same vehicle.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So you need to be able maybe so I can have Fred de man investing having one certificate for 1,000 units and Fred de mind having another certificate for another 1,000  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So,  
Fred Demargne: units.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh how do I the number here? What does it um depend on specifically? Is it only on the number?  
Fred Demargne: If you look at the so if you look at the dashboard uh you take the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: numbers it's just by you just put an index from one and you increment by one every time there is a new  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. So, it's just um All right.  
Fred Demargne: investment  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the the number of um equity certificate for specifically that person or generally  
Fred Demargne: uh so let me I'm going to explain to you on the dashboard. It's going to be easier.  
   
 

### 00:17:59

   
Fred Demargne: here. Share. Can you see my screen?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: So that the dashboard that we have online that's our bible.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So here you have an index every time there is a new  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: investment.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So this is this number.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: It's just a simple index.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Every time there's a new entry we increment by  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: one.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it um is it based on a specific vehicle or like series? It's grouped by series, right? Because when you go to another  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Look at the If you look at the tab,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: if you look at the tab, everything is always based on a series.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Got it. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I just wanted to All  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right.  
Fred Demargne: Uh let me share the other one again.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So this is clear.  
   
 

### 00:19:39

   
Fred Demargne: Then you have the number of units. So it's a position or the number of shares.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh this is is this calculated or uh defined by let's say the investor or the price per  
Fred Demargne: It's in a subscription contract.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: share  
Fred Demargne: You should get all of this from the subscription from So whenever there is an information about the investment that should come from the subscription  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah uh the subscription pack.  
Fred Demargne: contract.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So here when u when for example automatically the investor clicks okay I want to subscribe uh to this specific uh opportunity and I want to put 500,000 right but it does not put the units there does the system calculates unit uh units based on the um price per share for that specific vehicle.  
Fred Demargne: What do you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so the investor right when they uh try to subscribe  
Fred Demargne: mean?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: to something they have a CTA subscribe now uh from the investment um opportunities page when they click on it have a form to they have a form to fill  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
   
 

### 00:20:57

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: which is okay how much do you want to subscribe which is the main uh thing how much money they want to put in and based on the amount of money this unit um is this subscription is this shares is it calculated as shares. So you basically take the money uh that they want to invest and you um you divide it by the num the price of share and you will get the units. Is that how it is done or it's something that is is put there manually?  
Fred Demargne: Um, did Julian explain to you how this works or or you just guessed  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, let me let me remember.  
Fred Demargne: it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think what he explained to me is what I'm I'm telling you um right now. He didn't really explain to me right like this, but he mentioned stock and  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh  
Fred Demargne: So what did you so explain to me how did you implemented this when you generate when the investor expressed his interest?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. When investor  
Fred Demargne: How did you technically how did you code it?  
   
 

### 00:22:11

   
Fred Demargne: How did you implement  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So they click on a button uh inside the deal card or investment opportunity  
Fred Demargne: it?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: card. The button uh opens a form,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: a dialogue form where they will put how much money they want to invest uh in this investment opportunity and I think there is whether they want to invest uh through individually or  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: through a third party. We discussed that before if you remember but when  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um they submit it creates an approval for the CEO. CEO can see the information and approve. The moment they approve they need um a subscription record in the database will be created and um the information need to be sent to N8N to generate the subscription pack document right but this the information um it has uh how much units so number of shares right and this is calculated by the amount that they have um that they want to invest divided by the price um of one single unit. So this is put I think either in the term sheet or when you create an investment opportunity from the CEO, you have that number, you put it there and it it is divided.  
   
 

### 00:23:29

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so you divide the number they want to invest.  
Fred Demargne: So what is exact can you tell me exactly the fields that you use to make the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um  
Fred Demargne: calculation like precisely which database you get this from because that that's the one thing which is absolutely key and what is the formula that you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And let me see.  
Fred Demargne: used  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. Okay. Take a look. Could you sign in? Did you try to sign in  
Fred Demargne: Did I try to sign in where the CEO?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um with your account and  
Fred Demargne: Not yet. With the Yeah, yesterday I did, but with the CEO. Not yet. You want me to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um I think you do you remember the  
Fred Demargne: try?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: password?  
Fred Demargne: Do I remember the password?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah, you will have to reset it or I can delete you and send you  
Fred Demargne: No.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: again.  
Fred Demargne: I will try. Let me see.  
   
 

### 00:26:01

   
Fred Demargne: Let me guess because I set it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, you can set um reset password or something in those lines.  
Fred Demargne: myself.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um and it will send you a link to reset the password.  
Fred Demargne: Let me see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, here it is. Can you see my screen? Oh, you can't.  
Fred Demargne: No,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, sorry.  
Fred Demargne: because I'm sharing.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, no,  
Fred Demargne: Maybe I need to stop sharing.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: no. I think I just forgot to to share on my end.  
Fred Demargne: I managed to connect. So I don't need to reset the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Great. Uh when you click on your profile to the top top end,  
Fred Demargne: password.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: can you see multiple uh personas?  
Fred Demargne: Let me see. I see Co, arranger, introducer, partner, commercial partner, lawyer.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: great. Okay, can you see my screen? So, can you see this term sheet? Um, edit.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: By the way, I have a question, but I think we can get to that.  
   
 

### 00:27:23

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: When I go on create a term sheet or something, I can put price per share here. And this price per share when I go to the agent explanation, number of shares formula, other formula is here. So the number of shares is math as floor amount divided by price of share where amount is investor commitment amount um from subscription submission. So the amount that the investor wants to subscribe price per share is determined from the uh  
Fred Demargne: Mhm. Mhm.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: in priority order. So PE  
Fred Demargne: So what does that mean?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: structure  
Fred Demargne: What does that mean from in par which from So the price per chair is from which table? From the term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um yeah so it is inside the term sheet is a priority is when you don't put it in the term sheet uh sometimes it is extracted from um so term sheet is here when you go to overview or fee plans if I yeah so here Um you can put some metadata for the investment opportunity which is this.  
   
 

### 00:28:31

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So offer price per unit right but the um source of truth is term sheet. So only when there is no term sheet it the fallback is this right.  
Fred Demargne: What is what is this financial  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh this is just like data overview data of investment opportunity  
Fred Demargne: terms?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: data. So  
Fred Demargne: But where is this coming from? This uh offer price per unit.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's uh basically price per share uh where it's coming from when I create an investment opportunity I create the basic information but uh when I want to edit it I can edit everything. So because when I was working with Julian, we started creating this, right? And then he introduced turn sheets, right? So we created Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Ah s***. Okay, I understand now. You need to get rid of this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: H I think it doesn't matter in a way  
Fred Demargne: We need to get rid of this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: that you can just leave it blank and when you put a term sheet in, it's autos synchronized.  
   
 

### 00:29:37

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: The term sheet is a source of truth and it fills all of these. Uh it's like a company, arranger, location, target amount, maximum amount, timeline. I can I can get rid of it. It's not um doesn't take a lot of time, but it's synchronized. Um  
Fred Demargne: So as soon as you put one term sheet that's gets updated.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um yeah, so term sheet syncs with  
Fred Demargne: What happen if you have three term sheet at the same time?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh well it it puts one here but it's just the overview. I think it's for a  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: CEO.  
Fred Demargne: but we there would be several price at the same time. So which how does the system decide which one to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh here I think it it's randomly either the first one that is published the first term sheet that  
Fred Demargne: display?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: is active but for the investor when you dispatch it to the investor I added the question yesterday um and they changed it to you have to choose a term sheet that you want to dispatch to the investor for their own view right and therefore also it changes the um view for the others u other personas for introducer doesn't have term sheet But partner does and based on um yeah  
   
 

### 00:30:59

   
Fred Demargne: And what happen if a if a investor has received two different term sheets?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: they don't you have um  
Fred Demargne: Not at the same time obviously at different times.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: different times well I guess the document will be able to be downloaded when you go to the term sheet but there isn't a display of multiple term sheet in in the  
Fred Demargne: So my question is on this on this screen where it  
Ghiles Moussaoui: in  
Fred Demargne: says offer price per unit per share what will  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: happen if if a if an investor receive two different  
Ghiles Moussaoui: This  
Fred Demargne: term sheet at two different times. So let's say one week he receives one.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So when there is one I guess it's synchronized with one. The week after he hasn't invested. The week after you receive a new one. What  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The old one will be removed.  
Fred Demargne: happens?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You just change the term sheet that is dispatched to the in  
Fred Demargne: What do you mean the old one will be  
   
 

### 00:31:59

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: the investment opportunities.  
Fred Demargne: removed?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this one, this view will not be seen by the investor. This is CEO view. But in a similar way, say this is a term sheet for uh the investment opportunities page for the investor, right?  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Say this week I see this information. Next week the uh this number will change. This will change based on the you know the term sheet that you want the new term sheet that you want to apply. The fields will change automatically and the document that they can download will change as well.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And this is done also dynamically which means like if an investor is related to uh a partner and you change the term sheet for the investor I think the term sheet will also have to be changed for the partner. Is that correct?  
Fred Demargne: Yes,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: but a partner will have multiple term sheet for multiple  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: users.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it depends on how many users they have, right?  
   
 

### 00:33:01

   
Fred Demargne: So if you have two then one investor might might receive one term sheet with a price and then another one might receive another term sheet with a different  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: price.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: that is what I mean.  
Fred Demargne: So let's go let's just finish the conversation on the certificate.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,  
Fred Demargne: So the formula is basically the price per share in uh the term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. Formula is the amount um divided amount divided by price of share. Price per share.  
Fred Demargne: But the this amount is not coming from the so you didn't build a subs a database for the subscription pack.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I did. What do you mean?  
Fred Demargne: So then it shouldn't be the investment commitment amount, it should be the subscription  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. The investment it's um a flow,  
Fred Demargne: amount.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? So they have to put the number that they want to invest and if that number  
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Peter,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: sticks.  
Fred Demargne: we you Julian asked you remember Julian asked you to  
   
 

### 00:34:03

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: um so he has a view on the on the on the subscription pack. So before the sub the subscription pack is automatically generated but then he needs to approve  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I know it's set right now.  
Fred Demargne: He needs to approve and edit it if he needs to.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: What happen if you change the amount in the subscription pack?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh well a new subscription tag will be generated with the new amount because wait uh if you remember we discussed subscriptions subscriptions here. Say we pick one subscription here. So yeah um okay this is a negative number one record here of subscriptions equals one um subscription pack right every time a record of a new subscription is created or a new investment is created it's like the dashboard new subscription pack which generated so you see the detail there is commitment contributed and funded nav and I think there is price per uh Number of units somewhere number of shares here. So price per shareh here cost per share it's something you want to you can define structure here.  
   
 

### 00:35:35

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So number of shares is here. So it is calculated from that amount and it's generated it generates a subscription pack that will be inside the documents. For now there isn't because this is from the dashboard but you will have a subscription pack here. And if you don't like it, you want to change it, you come here, you change the information uh financial shares, you put the number of shares that you want and you click a button here on like uh completely regenerate and it will go regenerate and create a new version of the document here. And when it is ready, you click on uh done or like send for signature and uh it will basically put the signature  
Fred Demargne: That's good. So therefore it's not so if you come back to your formula  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: then I don't understand you say investment investors commitment amount from from subscription submission.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So the subscription submission is is not the interest it's what what is a subscription  
Ghiles Moussaoui: when they want to submit an interest of investment there is two type of interest in NDA in  
   
 

### 00:36:44

   
Fred Demargne: submission  
Ghiles Moussaoui: DNA sorry in data room information and interest in subscription directly they want to invest directly All  
Fred Demargne: but between the question is more I understand there are two flows no one  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right.  
Fred Demargne: is the investor himself express his interest  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: uh and that's what I understand by subscription submission and then there is another flow where the CEO change  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: the subscription amount so what I'm failing to understand is for me this is two  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: databases one is an an interest database because the the investor could change could change his mind. He could decide I want to invest one 100,000 and then the following uh the next hour he say oh no in the end I want to invest more.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So for me this two datab databases one is the expression of the interest  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: and one is the subscription.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. That is correct. It's um what  
Fred Demargne: So then that's why I I I don't understand between the two  
   
 

### 00:38:01

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I  
Fred Demargne: flows, one coming from the investor and one coming from the CEO which is amending the the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: contract.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I don't understand where do you get the information of the amount  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So here uh initially it's a process different  
Fred Demargne: technically?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: databases different tables just to make the process work end to end you know it's like an automatic process if accepted automatically the in the CEO can accept it and it works directly but if the CEO wants to change something they can but I think the uh talking with the investor is done mostly or like there will be a notification sent to the investor but it would be mostly outside the the portal I believe maybe a call or something. So when I go to investment um opportunities and I am inside the investor view when I click on subscribe to investment opportunity. So I can go to details page or I can click here I see this. So subscribe to investment opportunity uh you receive um NDA and subscription document to sign together uh this investment type.  
   
 

### 00:39:12

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can invest personally uh through your account or invest through um a trust or Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So that's that's the interest table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I put 500,000 here for example uh below a million. So there is minimum amount. I put accept and a submit. This will create an approval uh in the CEO's um view. So yeah entity is eligible invested time.  
Fred Demargne: Will that will that create will that create a new record in a new  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it will create the submission interest.  
Fred Demargne: table  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's a 5 million submission interest USD.  
Fred Demargne: with the summation interest is the initial table not a new  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's an initial record in the interest that how much the investor wants to invest. And yes,  
Fred Demargne: I know I understand but they they there they there are two different tables here one is so  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's the initial one. Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: when you click on the button when you submit you create a new record in the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: subscription  
   
 

### 00:40:23

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: No,  
Fred Demargne: table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: in submission uh in subscription um submission table. So subscription submission table  
Fred Demargne: So when do you create a new record to the subscription table?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: when the CEO approves this that the um investor can invest that much amount of money in that specific investment opportunity it does two things automatically.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It generates new record uh of subscriptions with status pending.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So nothing happened yet, no signature. And then it triggers the NAT and workflow to generate a subscription pack and then again subscription pack will come back to the it will be linked to the subscription record that has been created and then the CEO can go there see the document. If they like it they can send it for signature. If they want to edit it, they edit it and they regenerate the document to generate a new version and then they can send it to  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: signature.  
Fred Demargne: so it's good from an investor perspective. So, therefore it would be the same field between um Okay.  
   
 

### 00:41:27

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: If the CEO change the amount as you showed to me before,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: it's updating this sub subscription submission and not the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh it no like when uh let me go back sign  
Fred Demargne: subscription.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: out. Uh subscription submission it cannot um be edited. It doesn't mean um okay sorry I think it's better if I explain here. So here it's subscriptions right? If I see if I can find something. Okay, just choose one. So, right, this is subscription. Um, it's not submission anymore. The submission uh is just  
Fred Demargne: So then so then then there is a then I don't understand how this formula works because  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: if the investor put 100,000 okay so the initial calculation of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yep.  
Fred Demargne: units is based on uh the 100,000 divided by the price per share which was in the term sheet but before the CEO approves it the CEO changes it and move from 100,000 to 200,000.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:42:44

   
Fred Demargne: So, he's got the double amount of money uh amount of shares. If you if you if I look back to the formula you showed to me, uh it will not be updated because the formula is taking the information from the subscript subscription submission and when the CEO changed the number before  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: re uh issuing the contract, it was not changing the subscription  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, this is the loop,  
Fred Demargne: submission.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? Um, yes, you cannot edit it before you approve it. If you want to edit it, you can reject it, which will uh nothing will happen. I can add the rejection flow where you want to edit it, right? But um to be able to edit it, you can accept it which will show nothing for the investor, right? Um and then you come back to the subscription record that has been created specifically for that approval that you have done. And you come here, right? And you can change whatever you want. You can change all of the members uh from  
   
 

### 00:43:50

   
Fred Demargne: I think I mean I think the easiest way and maybe thinking from a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: database uh uh structuring u for me the easiest way is the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: formula needs not doesn't take the subscription submission the formula takes as a numerator the subscription So the information in the subscription  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. But the subscription table then is never generated if there is no submission the this  
Fred Demargne: table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: amount.  
Fred Demargne: No, no, I understand that.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I understand that. So here we're talking about where the units from the certificates come from.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's  
Fred Demargne: The units from the certificate should come from the subscription amount from the subscription table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Not the subscription submission from the subscription table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah, that is correct because uh this is what happens. It's just initially it is calculated and put here. But when you want to edit it, you will edit it and you will regenerate the subscription pack with the new number.  
   
 

### 00:44:53

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's just an a way for the subscription submission is just a table for staging to stage interest to store it as um  
Fred Demargne: No. Okay. Because I the question I asked you before and then and you show me this formula was how do you calculate the number of shares? And you said I'll show you the formula. The formula is what you show me on the code which is uh uh the amount  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: from the subscription submission divided by the price per share in the term sheet. So if this is the if this is your answer the the the answer is incorrect.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, how would you rather calculate it?  
Fred Demargne: It needs to be from the subscription. The number of units to display in the equity certificate needs to be the amount in a subscription table divided by the price per share in the term  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um okay. And who creates a subscription um amount in the subscription table?  
Fred Demargne: So if uh the CEO approves a document the way it was, the record in the subscription table uh uh gets the amount from the subscription submission.  
   
 

### 00:46:08

   
Fred Demargne: If the um the CEO change the amount for whatever reason before validating then there will be directly into the subscription table. But the the table that needs to be the reference cannot be the staging table. It needs to be the final table. The final table is a subscription table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, this is for this um calculate this for um because this has to be calculated at some point, right? And before creating subscription record,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, of  
Ghiles Moussaoui: before creating subscription record, you have only that amount.  
Fred Demargne: course.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You don't have this yet. Right? So once it is approved from the investor, then this will be created. And for future edits, like when they come here, they want to edit it, they want to regenerate the subscription pack, then it uses this and this. It doesn't use the amount of the submission anymore. That is just a stage in way to be able to have this. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Yes.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is how it works.  
   
 

### 00:47:20

   
Fred Demargne: The staging principle is okay. It's just uh it's just the data in the equity certificates cannot come from  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: the staging table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: There isn't number of shares in staging table. It's only the amount that comes from the staging table. I understand what you mean. So yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So the amount the amount that is used for the agree certificate needs to come from the subscription table not from the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: staging  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. It will come from the subscription pack that has been signed.  
Fred Demargne: table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah,  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the signed one.  
Fred Demargne: So that's very  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I know.  
Fred Demargne: important.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um there is there will be the signed one.  
Fred Demargne: But that's why it's I was trying to look at the data model. I cannot see this in the data model that you share with me.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's code. Yes.  
Fred Demargne: Where is the the data? So the the relationship between the table.  
   
 

### 00:48:10

   
Fred Demargne: So the equity certificate is in another table with different fields and I need to make sure that we need to make sure that we the data model that the information in that table is coming from the subscription table and only from the subscription table.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it is. Yes. Yeah, that is uh correct. Um and it's aligned of uh how we implemented it. So we just need to put back this. Okay. Um I think you have meeting in 5 minutes  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, let me see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: about  
Fred Demargne: I'm just going to check if it's cancel or not because I got a WhatsApp uh from the guys. It's postponed. Okay, it's postponed to 12.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: We have a staff meeting and we need to move by half an hour. Okay, so uh so I'm back to my to the equity certificate here. Um so you have so the date here I added. So that's the closing date.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Closing date should be from the term sheet.  
   
 

### 00:49:22

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So here uh so you have the vehicle verso capital 2 SCSP is a vehicle series 209 is a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: series um I don't know how you differentiated  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: it in databases  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so a vehicle has multiple  
Fred Demargne: but yeah  
Ghiles Moussaoui: series.  
Fred Demargne: exactly so here you have it like So that's the value. Maybe I will put the value in another color so it's clear. So that's the variable and the value. Then you have the vehicle company number. Company number. So again up this is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: a value  
Ghiles Moussaoui: this company number where is it from? I don't have it in the database. Uh, it was I'm never there from the sheet that Julian shared with me.  
Fred Demargne: So that needs to be added as a ve when you create a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: vehicle. Do you don't have a how do we create a new vehicle?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: If we have a new vehicle, where do we create the new  
   
 

### 00:50:43

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: vehicle?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: you go to vehicles in  
Fred Demargne: Let me see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: co  
Fred Demargne: Now that I'm the CEO profile, I'm going to check. So I'm here. So I go to uh am I the CEO here? No. Okay. Here I'm CEO. Okay. Vehicle. and I say create vehicle. So when you create a vehicle there is no investment because an an  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: investment is for a series. So here you have a registration number. I suppose that would be that's the the company number. So I will put registration number for you to make the link. But there is no investment  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, I can remove it. Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: name.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: because uh if you remember before we discussed this where you told me the series is not the same thing as a company. It can be something else,  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? So I added company table where it stores uh you know the  
   
 

### 00:52:00

   
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: company if it is company and the rest is uh yeah so I will just remove investment name.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So then um so I changed the registration number. So then you can make the link with what you have.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh so it's not vehicle but it's a vehicle name. No, I suppose a field it's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Where?  
Fred Demargne: um when I create a new vehicle I get create entity and then I've got entity name. I am at the CEO and I'm just uh to to make the link between uh the fields and what  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: you already have. Um when I create add create vehicle I have a popup it says create  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah.  
Fred Demargne: entity.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Then just name entity. I can change it to vehicle because before July told me let's  
Fred Demargne: So  
Ghiles Moussaoui: make it entities and then I removed it to vehicles but it did not change the dialogue form.  
Fred Demargne: okay vehicle name here that would be then and how do you call the series  
   
 

### 00:53:22

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: when you create a new series under the vehicle  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so for me when you put uh vehicle name so there's platform which is mostly vehicle the series is the series name on top. So uh it starts with the vehicle name say virtual capital one um SCSP and then the series name and followed  
Fred Demargne: So 209 is a name for you or is a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: by it's a code.  
Fred Demargne: code. So I put code.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I will  
Fred Demargne: I put series code. Okay. All right.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: change the name in here a little bit as  
Fred Demargne: Uh no no it doesn't matter.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: well.  
Fred Demargne: I'm just trying to make it clear for you. Uh I am not trying to change uh I mean it's true that when vehicle is better when  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: we create a new vehicle to have a pop-up which just create a new vehicle than to create an entity. But here my objective is to make sure that you have the fields crystal clear.  
   
 

### 00:54:23

   
Fred Demargne: So you don't have to make any assumptions.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: So here there should be uh last name uh no that should be first name last name of the investor or entity name of the investor.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: Okay here. So that's the number of shares that we have  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: here. I should call it number of certificates because there could be other thing that shares.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: It's not only shares  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: uh at least you have the same reference. So that's a value issued by the issuer backed by okay so this so this I don't know where so this is more complicated where do do you have a field uh for the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's dynamic.  
Fred Demargne: underlying  
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is in the line of the company?  
Fred Demargne: Uh it's going to be linked to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: orient.  
Fred Demargne: the you don't when you invest with us you don't invest directly in shares you invest in certificates and then each certificate has  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
   
 

### 00:56:10

   
Fred Demargne: a u a conversion ratio ratio with what you are investing in  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: really and this ratio is not always one  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. I get it.  
Fred Demargne: one.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get it.  
Fred Demargne: So normally in the term sheet when you create when you create a new term sheet you are supposed to say because that will be in the subscription pack as  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: well.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And they're  
Fred Demargne: So what are you investing in?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: laying  
Fred Demargne: So that's this. So shares of XAI series B preferred stock that should be a dynamic  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh can you just uh put it in yellow or some color so we  
Fred Demargne: field.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: remember? And what about the uh underlying shares? Is it calculated also dynamically? You said it's not one to one all the time or is it manual?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I should be calculated with a formula.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And where is the formula?  
Fred Demargne: Huh.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Where is the formula for um you said it's not one to  
   
 

### 00:57:28

   
Fred Demargne: So normally there is um yeah there is normally what we need to do is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: one.  
Fred Demargne: whenever we create um I think at the temp sheet level you need to create you need to add specifically that's not something  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: that the user that the investor will see but you need to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: specify uh the ratio so you need to specify two things one is what is the underlying that you investing in. So concretely what do you invest in?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: And the second thing is um if there is not a one one ratio we need to specify what is a ratio. So when it's one one we can have it by default one one and then if it's not  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: specified it's a one one and if it's specified then we need to apply a division. Uh so let me think how I called it before and that should be when you issue a term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh one second.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Could you could you later share the term sheet?  
   
 

### 00:58:37

   
Fred Demargne: So there are two fields here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, we discussed it yesterday.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Template.  
Fred Demargne: of course. Yeah, of course. I wanted to show it to you now because it's not finished, but I wanted to also show it to you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh uh where did I put this? I didn't when I was doing it. I was not doing it at the temp sheet level.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.  
Fred Demargne: One second. I'm just checking what I was doing. But it's better to do it at the term sheet level. Uh anyway, uh  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I need  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, it was at investment opportunity level. One second. Here is not it was here. Where did I put this? It's weird. I need to check. I need to check because I don't see where I had it before. It was because uh the way we had done it, we had different uh a different data model before.

Fred Demargne: Um so the underlying which then appear in the subscription contract low right contract. So that's different. So then it means I did it in a in a term sheet there, but I don't see it. Allocation amount. Allocation description. Shares. Ah, there was this collateral. No, shares collateral amount. Wait. So, it must be this one. And the shares collateral amount. Was it in the map temp term sheet term sheet term sheet term sheet term sheet that was the last one collateral amount collateral amount collateral I need to check. Um, I don't want you to waste your time. I need to check because I remember that I was specifically entering this information. And I don't see now. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: uh I will I will explain but basically there are two fields here. Okay. Uh one is a number which is a calculation and one is a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: text.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: And line shares of XAI series B preferred stock.  
   
 

### 01:03:36

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think um this I I can understand how it is generated by when the series is a company or investment opportunity is a company but um in case for example it's real estate or something like that I don't know what other types of investment opportunities because mostly I tested and worked with companies so Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Um anyway, so that's the vehicle name. I will finish it. I will send to you. But at least when you receive it now, you understand. So I have the vehicle name here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: And then you have the vehicle  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: address.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Don't miss.  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So uh enjoy they are the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: works. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: manager.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, okay.  
Fred Demargne: So I think I think we can um I think for the moment we can just code it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hardcoded. Uh, sure. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think there is versal sign where they go and sign what I from when I was working with user stories.  
   
 

### 01:04:56

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is um signature spiceman. So drawing that you can hardcode every time that you want to sign something. Should we work with that or should we make the user sign every time for a document digitally? Of  
Fred Demargne: No,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: course.  
Fred Demargne: I think I think um it's a good question. Do we use virtual sign? Because the user doesn't sign up. It's um it's just us.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I mean for multiple  
Fred Demargne: So it's just Russian capital to a CSP who is signing  
Ghiles Moussaoui: documents. Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean for all of the other documents as well because most personas have versus sign. They can either uh go to versign. For now it's mostly implemented. They go there and they sign digitally. So they open the signature task. It opens a drawing uh place where they can draw their signature and it will be put inside the document. Um but I suppose it's better to also add if they have a signature spicement to also apply that directly there based on user as well inside that entity if they have multiple signaries.  
   
 

### 01:06:07

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I think that I think as long as it's signed uh for now  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I think we should we should bring it just fine. We'll see later if we complexify it, but I think let's make it simple. Okay, there's already lots to do.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: Uh if you can just R code it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Okay. Yeah, makes sense.  
Fred Demargne: Okay, so uh I'll need to get back to you on two things and send it to you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Okay, so that was the first one. Uh stop sharing. uh than the other one. The we're just going to go from the easiest things. I thought this will be easier.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh NDA. So Gian just sent it to me this morning. Uh I don't think there is anything special to I will resign it to you, but I think uh it's relatively straightforward. Let me share so that you see uh quickly. But I think that's relatively straightforward.  
   
 

### 01:07:35

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is one thing uh okay I have two questions regarding that  
Fred Demargne: Can you see my screen?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: only uh  
Fred Demargne: And this NDA  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yep the first one is the logo  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You the example you gave me has a logo of the investment opportunity. Is that necessary or nice to have?  
Fred Demargne: You're talking about the NDA.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: The logo is a logo from uh the vehicle.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, there is the example you shared with me has um another logo.  
Fred Demargne: Let me  
Ghiles Moussaoui: has two logos.  
Fred Demargne: see.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: They mean the investment opportunity like the company of the series and yeah okay got it  
Fred Demargne: Oh yeah. No, I don't think it's critical.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and okay okay um Biden  
Fred Demargne: We can do nice to have but  
Ghiles Moussaoui: secondary issuance on December where is this date coming from Biden's  
Fred Demargne: And that should come from the from the term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, you  
Fred Demargne: So that's so that should come from the term  
   
 

### 01:08:57

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: should  
Fred Demargne: sheet. Yeah. So, uh, vehicle name, I'm going to do the same on the one I'm going to send to resend you because Julian just sent me one. So, if you look at your screen, uh, So VC 206 like this like if you see on my screen this you you know how to reconstruct it or  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So,  
Fred Demargne: not.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, I I the vehicle and series and the series code and then the series  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: code and number. I mean, not Yeah, I do. We  
Fred Demargne: Okay. Service code. Okay. So that should Okay. Up. This should be the opportunity name. Opportunity name.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: represented by um are you  
Fred Demargne: Huh?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: editing? I don't see your screen. I think you I see one screen that is  
Fred Demargne: I am editing. Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: not  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: changing.  
Fred Demargne: The problem of uh Google Meets.  
   
 

### 01:11:21

   
Fred Demargne: I hate this.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You can share an entire screen.  
Fred Demargne: Uh window  
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is what I do.  
Fred Demargne: share.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you click share and the entire screen, you can choose a screen if you have multiple  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So here you have it. Can you  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. I do. Yeah, there is no problem. Um  
Fred Demargne: see?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: and below. So here represented by  
Fred Demargne: So here we need to have at the at the vehicle level we need to have the managing partner.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. And then the rest is text text. The date I think is clear and the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, here signature how many uh would like signatories if there is  
Fred Demargne: signature  
Ghiles Moussaoui: multiple where do  
Fred Demargne: every I mean the way the way I consider it last time when I was doing it the easiest way we  
Ghiles Moussaoui: we  
Fred Demargne: assessed it is every member of an entity who is a senator needs to sign a separate NDA.  
   
 

### 01:12:55

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: It's easier I think  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: because if if you have to uh if you have to get all the senator to sign the same document at this point in time it's a bit more complicated because you may not have all of them  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: but then you have to wait to issue the final document that you get all of them you have to reissue the document to get it signed. So it's complicated. So every every every each and every individual who is a signatory needs to sign a separate  
Ghiles Moussaoui: But then for example if they want to have access to the data room and they have five signatories and four of  
Fred Demargne: NDA.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: them signed so they will not have access to it. Okay. So it requires all of the signatories to have signed.  
Fred Demargne: No.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Got it. Is this the same thing with subscription pack? I think they have the sign.  
Fred Demargne: No. To jump back. It's one document.  
   
 

### 01:14:02

   
Fred Demargne: By the time that the investor decided to invest,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: we need to have collected all the senior of the entity.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So he shouldn't be able to express his interest if we don't have it.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: So the document when is it the subscription pack when it's issued is got all the signatur users in it for  
Ghiles Moussaoui: All  
Fred Demargne: signature.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: right.  
Fred Demargne: It's just at the NDA step. We don't know.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: And here it's a vehicle logo. I think that's it for this in the air. I don't think there's many. I mean I didn't put here but everything is obviously  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: a field that you need that the system automatically filled  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: in.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, there is no problem.  
Fred Demargne: Maybe we should have series 206 as a one field. I think it's  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um for me when I created it's a code it's a string uh so it's like a  
Fred Demargne: better.  
   
 

### 01:15:31

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: a text that combines multiple variables and generates that. So I just um exactly  
Fred Demargne: So it generates series 206. So it's generate just 206.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: like how it is supposed to be. So if it is always so series will just sit there. Uh it's not a variable anymore. If it's yeah it's a string that  
Fred Demargne: Ah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: takes that takes um the variable that  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: generates.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. I understood.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: I understood. I mean, we're not going to change this now, but it's not ideal for the for other vehicle, but that's okay. Let's not we can't change everything now. Uh,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, we can  
Fred Demargne: and then you have the dates here. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: take.  
Fred Demargne: I put in blue so that I doesn't work like this. I put like this, but I guess it's obvious, but just to make sure. And here we need to put month. So, it's a date when you issue the document.  
   
 

### 01:16:36

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: I'm just putting like this so you are not any surprise. Okay. So that's done. I will resign it to you with a color code.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh up then the next one it would be the term sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So here in term sheet uh Let me share with you.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: You didn't send me a template yet.  
Fred Demargne: Well, because Julian sent to me another one which is not complete.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: Uh because there are things which doesn't make sense um or things which are missing. So I need to but I just want to show you So all those fields here whether it's text or not text needs to be filled in by the CEO when you create a new investment opportunity the new  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Got it.  
Fred Demargne: termship.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,  
Fred Demargne: So the logo I think the logo for the same reason that we discussed before is not the end of the world.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.  
Fred Demargne: If we have only one logo it's okay.  
   
 

### 01:18:07

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Uh but we need to have every single  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. The question is um is it better to be  
Fred Demargne: field.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: done digitally or is it better to create a document every time or is it the digitally?  
Fred Demargne: Yeah, you you enter the information uh in the platform and then you have the possibility to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: download following the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: A document. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: template.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So it to be generated as well.  
Fred Demargne: But the all those fields all those fields needs to be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: available when you when you create a new term  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, of  
Fred Demargne: sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: course.  
Fred Demargne: Some of them some of the field type will be a drop-own menu. So for instance aranger we have a list of aranger.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: True.  
Fred Demargne: So you just need to select the aranger.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: Okay. So there are things which are missing uh here. Uh but you see you have this closing date completion date is is here.  
   
 

### 01:19:17

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: So that would be to link it to our conversation yesterday.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: got  
Fred Demargne: Um here the validity dates. So in theory I don't know if you have built the mechanism. If not, I think we need to see whether it's critical or not. But in theory, this temp  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: expires.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So for me what I understood before is that closing date is the same thing as um the deadline for a term sheet that expires.  
Fred Demargne: I know the the the expire the vality date is when the term sheet is  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Got it.  
Fred Demargne: valid,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: but the completion is when the closing. So the closing could be after  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I get  
Fred Demargne: But it's true that it's misleading because at the in this one for instance where Julian sent me this morning you see  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.  
Fred Demargne: you have the same date. So it's misleading uh for interest confirmation for completion date and for validity date.  
   
 

### 01:20:18

   
Fred Demargne: So it cannot be the same  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I get that.  
Fred Demargne: date.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem. Now set it  
Fred Demargne: Uh so here there are things which are missing but what is important  
Ghiles Moussaoui: up.  
Fred Demargne: is here there needs to be some vocabulary that we're going to use in the certificate you see and in the contract. So preferred share of XAI corp. So this is the underlying I mean it's part of the information is the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: underlying.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: So I need to extract it. Well, so that the way I did it for the previous project that is clear. Um so here you have a price per share uh which is the price per share for the investment opportunity for the investor at the moment. Where do you put the cost per share?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: cost per share is not is not like it's subscription level has all of the fields that the dashboard has right um so you can edit it there but it was to calculate the credits there from the subscription record So it's like here uh on  
   
 

### 01:21:30

   
Fred Demargne: But where where as a CEO do I insert the value of the cost per share?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: the subscription level for now. So when you go to subscriptions as I showed you when you can want to edit the subscription uh regenerate subscription pack you can also edit the everything basically for share  
Fred Demargne: Ah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: cost  
Fred Demargne: so you need to do it subscription by subscription. Okay, this Julian is not going to like it here.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.  
Fred Demargne: Julian is not going to like it. Uh but this I understand because based on the way you built it, you have no other  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I mean I can put it on the either entity level um for  
Fred Demargne: way.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: evaluations um but I think yeah I don't know I put it this way because for me it makes sense from the dashboard uh recreated somewhat  
Fred Demargne: Listen  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um similar in the platform so it's not very misleading.  
Fred Demargne: here. What is No, but I understand what is very important because u now what I just discovering is something completely new and it's very structural.  
   
 

### 01:22:43

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: Um it's very important that you we document this that we document  
Ghiles Moussaoui: we don't comment.  
Fred Demargne: this  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, what you mean?  
Fred Demargne: the user guide for the CEO to understand what he needs to do when you approve a  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. a document. Okay.  
Fred Demargne: subscription.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I get it.  
Fred Demargne: So for me at the m for me what I understood so far is the co just approve it's a yes or  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Uh the Yes,  
Fred Demargne: no I  
Ghiles Moussaoui: that is correct. So my logic  
Fred Demargne: know because he needs to put the subscript the price the cost per  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Um but the cost per share can also be inherited.  
Fred Demargne: share  
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's just not defined. I didn't know where it will be defined. It can be defined on the term sheet level and it will be the same. It will be put here when the subscription row is um you know generated.  
   
 

### 01:23:43

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can do that. I can change that in five minutes. I just need to know where it is inherited from. Is it from the  
Fred Demargne: Yeah,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: vehicle?  
Fred Demargne: it shouldn't be in a term sheet because the term sheet is uh is a document for the user for the investor.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it can be the overview of the subscription if you  
Fred Demargne: so normally I don't know how you structure the data model but normally there is there are two different things there are many different object there is a vehicle there is a series there is a investment opportunity there is a term sheet  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So for me, vehicle in series, I put it in one. So a vehicle is just the same name. Let's say vual capital 2 CSP that changes um let's say from one to two and from other but uh it's like a variable inside the row. So it's one table for series and vehicle right as I as I created it. Uh and then there is investment opportunities, there is term sheets,  
   
 

### 01:24:40

   
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: there is metadata for investment opportunities that synchronizes with term sheet in case. And what  
Fred Demargne: So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: else?  
Fred Demargne: can you send me the um could you send me the the the the table for the investment opportunity? So before the term sheet  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.  
Fred Demargne: because here what do I have?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me see if I can extract it here right  
Fred Demargne: I've got here the deal subscription  
Ghiles Moussaoui: now.  
Fred Demargne: submission.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is term sheet or user term.  
Fred Demargne: There's one which is deal and the deal is is vehicle ID arranger entity ID created by it links to what it links to  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. So when you go to deals, this is deals. Um and this is the type of data you have in deals. You have vehicle ID. Here you have ID created by arranger ID company ID. Yeah. Can you see my screen?  
Fred Demargne: I I got disconnected. I'm just I just reconnected.  
   
 

### 01:26:29

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: If you can share again.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see it? So this is deals which is investment opportunities and this is the the  
Fred Demargne: Yeah.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: fields that they have. So and there is sheet um loan  
Fred Demargne: So now you need to create a new object which is temp sheet.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So when you create a deal, a row is created here and then you can create a term sheet uh here and  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah sometimes I think this is something  
Fred Demargne: Okay.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: else.  
Fred Demargne: So the deal So because I was in a DB diagram. So if I go to here uh tables here deals deal deals no description. Yeah I'm there. So I mean deals. So here you've got deal type, currency. Uh created  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.  
Fred Demargne: investments.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: The term sheet I showed you uh the table term sheet is not where the data of the term sheet is stored.  
   
 

### 01:28:19

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh that is for the document because before Julian told me okay let's make it possible to edit it digitally but I want to put the document there and link it right so it's not generating a document but put in a document in as the example you showed me like document will be generated externally but I think I will change this today uh the real term sheet data uh when you create it manually um digitally it's in DLC structures it's called. So I will move this to term GD if it's better and you have  
Fred Demargne: deal. What does that mean?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: a it's the table that is used to store the  
Fred Demargne: Deals fee structure.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: columns uh for the each field of the term sheet. You can see here uh there is the status published uh draft there is a version term sheet date transaction type opportunity summary um you showed it to me issuer vehicle um exclusive arranger purchaser seller structure allocation up to date price per share tax minimum ticket maximum subscription fee % uh management fee carried interest percent legal council interest confirmation deadline capital call timeline uh completion yeah so there is a lot of uh stuff here quality date completion date completion date is already here I believe she attachment attachment key updated effective  
   
 

### 01:30:09

   
Fred Demargne: So why do We have the wire bank uh here  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um I'm not sure I'm not sure where bank name bank Luxmbborg I think  
Fred Demargne: should be it should be it should not be in a term there should be  
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's  
Fred Demargne: um because one term  
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay  
Fred Demargne: sheet could um uh it shouldn't be in the term sheet it's not in the term sheet but is it a bad idea to have it there Uh, I don't know. I'm going to have to go now because they are calling me. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: so let me try to finish uh to send you the document. Maybe we can have a quick call later today.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, sure.  
Fred Demargne: Um, I will not wait until I finish to send you everything because then you're going to wait for me. Um,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I also have some work on uh development side term sheet would  
Fred Demargne: so which documents do you need first?  
Ghiles Moussaoui: be great because we're working we started it. Um so yeah the ones that we went through that you edited did not share the those.  
   
 

### 01:31:32

   
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, NDA's certificate, term sheet, and subscription pack whenever you can. And there's also the agreement for  
Fred Demargne: introducer. Yes. So, introducer,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: um  
Fred Demargne: he sent me the one that I had, so I can send you right away.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Uh what about the um is there an agreement for the commercial partner document?  
Fred Demargne: uh it's a bit more complicated this one.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: I don't think we're going to have when we launch. Uh I think we're going to have to deal with it separate outside of the platform and  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.  
Fred Demargne: to put the numbers for the fees in manually in in the system.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. So  
Fred Demargne: So NDA I G I just prepare introduction doc introducer. Yeah. The only thing is we need to be careful. Um we need to be as open as possible the type of fees. Um, I'm going to send you what I Julian confirmed to me this morning so that you have it.  
   
 

### 01:32:50

   
Fred Demargne: Um, but the rest I need to work on it uh for the moment. So, NDA NDA and introducer agreement for the moment. So,  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.  
Fred Demargne: I will try to do before two um before 2 p.m. for the term sheet and the  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.  
Fred Demargne: certificate.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: Uh and then the subscription pack. I need to d because he sent me uh some comments and I need to review what he sent me, what J sent me before I send to you. So, I will do the term sheet and a certificate before 2 p.m.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.  
Fred Demargne: and then um  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh subscription pack later on if you could or tomorrow.  
Fred Demargne: yeah. Yeah, I will try to do it today.  
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I try to get them done today plus the fee models. I changed everything yesterday. I add documentation if you want to check it out. Um it's inside the done engineering task. You'll see what I've done and then I will continue testing processes. So yeah. All right. Yeah. Um yeah. Thanks for your time.
