Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: Hey, so because I'm not sure how should I explain to you the different section of the email. That's why I prefer to have a a quick call.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: But first of all, when you designed the email, did you get any instructions from
Ghiles Moussaoui: Only one.
Fred Demargne: J?
Ghiles Moussaoui: The one for invitation. That is the only one that we got.
Fred Demargne: So let me let me try to send to share with you. I'll take the old one. So that was very first one. I don't think you was when we had virtual holdings. So it was this one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yeah. This is
Fred Demargne: So verso here is good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: in
Fred Demargne: Um if I go here is different.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is deal invitation. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I know. But I'm talking about the logo here and the background.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it was all generated quickly because I did not have any way um reference. I just, you know, it was part of not notifications.
 
 
00:02:02
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I wasn't even sure if the email should be included right before we did not have much notification. It was emails.
Fred Demargne: No, I think email is good because since it's not an application that there is no way to um to notify properly the user, you know, uh outside of the context of being connected.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I think we must send an email in that case.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: My question is why is the logo I mean the logo should be the same across all the emails and the backgrounds behind the logo should be the same in all the emails.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Isn't this?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Should I have one style like with no colors or anything like the black and
Fred Demargne: And yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: white for Okay.
Fred Demargne: this is perfect for me because that's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: that's clean. Let me take out when was it? Um because this is annoying.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: This uh um So it's here you see. So the verso is very clean is very nice.
 
 
00:03:21
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: And then you have a simple gray line here to to separate the logo from I think that's okay. Um I think I think that's better like this. I think the font, what kind of font did you
Ghiles Moussaoui: No idea.
Fred Demargne: use?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think for the logo, if I remember correctly, it's versus Spartan. I mean, Spartan,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: but for the rest, it's basic. I didn't really pay attention to it.
Fred Demargne: Okay. And I think here, so I think the only thing is we need to change the color uh let me see of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sure.
Fred Demargne: buttons. Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should I just make it access portal instead of access investor portal because when it's not an investor?
Fred Demargne: yeah, it should be access portal. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um access portal or access virtual portal maybe portal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: access berso or berso tech.
Fred Demargne: I would say a verso to simplify. We'll see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um I'm just checking now while we speak because um Julian likes to make logo and stuff.
 
 
00:04:48
 
Fred Demargne: Uh and I think the color of the logo is not black. Is it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: No idea. I think it's
Fred Demargne: Let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: black.
Fred Demargne: It's back except the arrow. How do I share
Ghiles Moussaoui: The verso tech
Fred Demargne: this?
Ghiles Moussaoui: one.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Uh, if you go on the website, let me see if I go on verse.com.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, he used a different logo.
Fred Demargne: So, okay. So, you see the arrow in front of it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: It's uh I think we should use that color for all the
Ghiles Moussaoui: The blue.
Fred Demargne: buttons.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: blue.
Fred Demargne: that's a kind of blue. Yeah. Can you can you scrub the website to know which color you used? Let me see if there's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Which logo?
Fred Demargne: um Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Specifically the one verse attack. Right. Okay.
Fred Demargne: the one on the top left.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think I can go in
 
 
00:05:58
 
Fred Demargne: Let me see if there is a PBT. Oh, wait, wait.
Ghiles Moussaoui: with
Fred Demargne: There is a PowerPoint version of it so I can share it to you. Yeah, there is a PowerPoint version. So, you don't have to worry about this. I will download it. download
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should it be Verso or Verso Tech in the website, the emails?
Fred Demargne: where no I think verso is fine. um as we discussed you know the only thing where verso tech appear in the in the email uh extension no uh apart from this I don't think we should
Ghiles Moussaoui: Verse is also the logo used inside the platform uh on top of the sidebar.
Fred Demargne: um
Ghiles Moussaoui: For example,
Fred Demargne: inside where
Ghiles Moussaoui: the sidebar of the portal when you log in.
Fred Demargne: Let me see because I don't log in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Even even the login
Fred Demargne: often.
Ghiles Moussaoui: page
Fred Demargne: Let me So I'm going to go to in the production page not to screw my testing. Where is it's here.
 
 
00:07:24
 
Fred Demargne: Uh yeah, here it's a production. Julian is calling me. Uh this is Yeah. Yeah, I see verso tech on the top. Yeah, but that's okay. And then you have there's a bit of an issue with um if I am on the main let me share my screen. And my laptop is slow now. Okay. So if I go here, I just want to share my screen. It's here. Stop sharing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think there is an issue with the logo by the way because uh the the logo versions uh Julian shared are square so the versat is not visible. visible much. So I have to zoom into it which decreases the quality a little bit.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, that's what I wanted to mention to you. The quality seems to be poor,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: isn't it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Because uh you have to zoom to Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You see here on the top
Ghiles Moussaoui: And when you close the sidebar, can you try to close it?
 
 
00:09:28
 
Fred Demargne: left
Ghiles Moussaoui: See there is some local issue there.
Fred Demargne: as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. the the
Fred Demargne: So let me let me send you the PowerPoint version of the logo so that you can
Ghiles Moussaoui: vers
Fred Demargne: see the the
Ghiles Moussaoui: and the verse tech in text above in the header not in the
Fred Demargne: properties.
Ghiles Moussaoui: sidebar. Uh it's just something I wrote there. Should I remove it or just keep it there? Should I write something else?
Fred Demargne: One second. I'm just sending you the email.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So uh reversal tech logo. Okay. I just sent you the file pip in PowerPoint so you can play with it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um so you are seeing this one
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: there's text statics text.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. I don't think it's bad. Um, the other thing I could think about is to put Verso,
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's Yeah.
Fred Demargne: but maybe we don't
Ghiles Moussaoui: redundant if you tell me.
 
 
00:10:57
 
Fred Demargne: need Yeah, because we have we have it on the top on the top
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: left.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can keep also or I can just put it in the middle. So, so sidebar I will remove the logo from there.
Fred Demargne: What do you want to put in the middle?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Put it in the header in instead of the text.
Fred Demargne: Sorry, I'm not following you. What did you say that you can put in the middle?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, you see the text right now. I would basically replace it with the logo the the
Fred Demargne: Which which text
Ghiles Moussaoui: verse. Yeah, I would replace that with a logo and the sidebar would have no logo
Fred Demargne: here? Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: or uh I mean when it closes it's not
Fred Demargne: I think it's I think on the sidebar it's good though.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's not uh that um the vector is not pointing right or it's missing.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but just just hide it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Just don't The simple way to get rid of this effect is to get rid of the logo when you click on the
 
 
00:11:55
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I wanted to make it that only the you know the arrow is
Fred Demargne: sidebar.
Ghiles Moussaoui: visible.
Fred Demargne: No, no, I understand. But I think it's going to you're going to spend lots of time to adjust where I don't think it's critical.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think it's more common to have the logo on the on the left hand side,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: isn't it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Let me see if I go to a bank website. One second. Um, I'm just checking one thing. Yeah, it's it's more common to have it on the left hand side,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: I think.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that's correct.
Fred Demargne: So, I I I prefer like I prefer you leave it like this on the left if there are just I mean to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: improve the quality uh to put the white in the the the arrow
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: in blue as I sent you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Julian sent two things. He sent a version that is black and white and he sent the blue version as well.
 
 
00:13:12
 
Fred Demargne: I mean I I p I just say it to you. So effect you have the the latest version of the logo in PowerPoint.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um so normally the arrow so there are two slides on one is arrow is is blue and then the arrow is black and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you change light mode? I think it
Fred Demargne: eventually
Ghiles Moussaoui: changes.
Fred Demargne: it's confusing with Google meetage where I share my screen and not on the one second. So here
Ghiles Moussaoui: See uh the first tech changes to
Fred Demargne: light it's
Ghiles Moussaoui: blue.
Fred Demargne: good just I will you need it because you tried with a black background and it was weird blue
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh what do you mean black background?
Fred Demargne: arrow
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, I just took because it's an image. So, I just took that and I changed it to light mode. What makes sense? See?
Fred Demargne: just I mean of course you I agree with you the verse the font need to go from
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:14:31
 
Fred Demargne: uh from um from white to black if you switch to dark and colorwise you're not going to see anything but I think You can leave the arrow in
Ghiles Moussaoui: blue.
Fred Demargne: uh in blue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um the image is it blue always?
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean what I I meant it's two different
Fred Demargne: The image of what
Ghiles Moussaoui: images, right? This logo uh in light mode is uh a different image from the other logo. Julian sent me two uh logos. So, one when it's light mode, the other one when it's dark.
Fred Demargne: Did you open the file I sent
Ghiles Moussaoui: Not yet.
Fred Demargne: you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me just open it. Oh, yeah. So, I have both.
Fred Demargne: So I think the best way I would suggest you to do is you add a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: uh let me see you add a back one slide with a the black background and then if we add this the logo is an image. Yeah. No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:15:42
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And uh
Fred Demargne: the text is not an image.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So, uh yeah, but the background is not an image. But let me see. Shape outline shape field black. Uh and then the text in white. So, look, I did it. um uh shape. So I'll show you using Mac now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I am.
Fred Demargne: So you're probably going to waste lots of time. Let me show you what I can resend it to you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: What I did is super simple. Uh so basically what I so the fight you have has has a two slides and I just added one slide in the middle.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I put the black background I left the arrow in blue and I put the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: text.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I think if you just take a a snapshot and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: put as a photo I think that will make the job.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Fred Demargne: So let me save
 
 
00:16:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it. Let's V3 output not to mix. Okay, let me recite to you so that you don't have to do anything special.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: All right, done. So I think I would leave the So let me share again my screen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: good.
Fred Demargne: Um, I think I would leave the the the top empty. So, the middle top where you have tech.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think I will I will leave it empty. Maybe we can think afterwards about something else.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um, and I will improve the logo on the on the left. Um, here the real time connected last update. Um, why did you put it on the top?
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's just data freshness.
Fred Demargne: No, I I understand my my question is why why you put it on the very top of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. It's not design choice.
Fred Demargne: screen?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I can It's no
Fred Demargne: I think maybe I will put it at the bottom.
 
 
00:18:50
 
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: problem.
Fred Demargne: what do you think? I don't think it's useless. I think it's useful to to indicate, but I don't think it's critical. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: I would put it um
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean it's useful for example when you check okay um confusion in the data you check maybe there is an issue it's not updated yet.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, of course. Of course.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: With the refresh button. I think maybe the refresh button, I don't think it's critical, but we could have it. Um, I mean, people on the website, they can refresh the page,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: isn't it? So, you can leave it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But
Fred Demargne: You just put the block at the bottom. If you can reduce the size of the block,
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: you see um here it's one size on on this right on the on
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: the on the on the side and here is nicer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:19:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You see? And here there's something weird. I don't know if it's my page here. Do you see the image?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it is normal. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: Is it normal?
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's just a design thing. I copied components that are already built that are open source.
Fred Demargne: I think it would be better to to keep the the small one, you know,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: in but not to have the thing in the background
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So this is for the dashboard of the CEO executive dashboard
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to remove the overlapping icons of the KPIs. Okay.
Fred Demargne: You can you can get rid of it for everybody I
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean this dashboard is only for CE
Fred Demargne: think.
Ghiles Moussaoui: and Oh
Fred Demargne: Okay. But if you have done this logo this uh sync for other things I think you
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: can get rid of it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should I delete them?
Fred Demargne: So here just if you could adjust the boxes so that they start like here.
 
 
00:20:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think they are the same as the one the ones
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: below.
Fred Demargne: They're not exactly the same because you don't have active deals, but compliance is there. Yeah, I think you can delete them. Just start with a financial operation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can remove I can remove the the compliance index and
Fred Demargne: Of course,
Ghiles Moussaoui: replace it with active deals. Um and then yeah I wouldn't have yeah I mean it's just a dashboard to see the
Fred Demargne: it's active. Yes, you can have it here. Now, when you click on active
Ghiles Moussaoui: overview stuff.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, in follow we'll see if we need to adjust with J. I don't want you to start doing something and then redo it several times.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So just get get rid of it. The four I agree with you those four things we don't need.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: We start from financial operation executive det.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: But I was not calling you for this.
 
 
00:21:43
 
Fred Demargne: Um, so coming back to the emails,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh, it just I mean I'm not I'm not going to give you all the comments like this on the fly. I need to prepare an a proper email so that it's easier for you. I just want you to know what has been defined with Julian first.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So only one the one I told
Fred Demargne: Let me open the email.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you
Fred Demargne: So uh let me share again my screen. I hate this uh system to
Ghiles Moussaoui: you can share the way I do I share the entire screen and then just switch from tabs
Fred Demargne: share entire screen. Yeah, let me do that. When I click on entire screen, I cannot share.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Really?
Fred Demargne: It doesn't give me the option.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Are you in Mac?
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I
Fred Demargne: I'm on Microsoft.
Ghiles Moussaoui: think
Fred Demargne: So, so I think all the emails should have the same design here for the logo.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um, I know here we changed it in the email uh address.
 
 
00:22:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's already
Fred Demargne: Do we have Verso with a space?
Ghiles Moussaoui: done.
Fred Demargne: Because there's no space between the letter. You see here you have a space between the letter.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: We have V space E space R space S space O and then no reply at mail.verso.com.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, just spaces in the name of the email which we're sending emails from.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, because now I receive an email. You see now? So now you have it like this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So if we could add a space here between the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: letters.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Good.
Fred Demargne: So, so here what I was the reason why we discussed the color uh in the logo is I'd like to change here the but all the buttons should have the same color.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And is it the blue?
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um so you see this this kind of format I think it's it's lean it's it's professional. It's clear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: And then if you compare to the one that you that I doing now more recently,
 
 
00:24:06
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I've got this type of design.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I
Fred Demargne: So that's why for me it's difficult to tell you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: understand.
Fred Demargne: So just this section of logo as you saw I think deal invitation we don't need because you already have in the title. So you don't need to put here deal invitation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: You just keep the same style of of of speaking that we had before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. If
Fred Demargne: The button here view in portal uh should be or I would say view deal instead of view in portal. And here the button should be centered as as I showed you before in invitation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand. Yeah. Um I
Fred Demargne: I don't think I would I don't think I would put if you have any questions please contact our
Ghiles Moussaoui: mean
Fred Demargne: team. Um uh I don't think for because I think I think if we want to do that we need to have a specific email address to provide here because if we say please contact our team through the platform that's a bit weird uh because we're not really giving them a solution how to ask us question.
 
 
00:25:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: We're just telling them to go back to the to the web where they came back they came from. So I I I I will not write I mean write it like this um I should ask maybe Julian if if he
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is Sure.
Fred Demargne: wants to add a text like this where we provide the problem of the I mean it's it's a bit of a chicken and eggs issue is if you provide the email address here then some people will just send the email without even trying to understand. Um, and for those who already have an issue, don't they have a a place to do that um in the platform?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean they have messages.
Fred Demargne: Uh as
Ghiles Moussaoui: They are an investor. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: investor let me
Ghiles Moussaoui: they have messages.
Fred Demargne: see. So where where do you have a where do you get to um have a button where you can say ask questions or whatever?
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is only the messages when it is and you have to contact them first.
 
 
00:26:44
 
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, that's not exactly what I'm referring
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that's the only thing that exists right now.
Fred Demargne: to. So, here if I let me share my screen here. Um so here I'm connected as an investor. Shouldn't I have uh somewhere where I can ask a question?
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if you go to inbox, if somebody um sends you a message, you will see it here. So you can see Pierre um Julian is you.
Fred Demargne: But if I want to if if the user here Pan wants to send a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh there isn't anything.
Fred Demargne: request
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean when I designed the messages for Julian he said yeah we just want us first to contact them. Uh not them first.
Fred Demargne: Here you have contact versus
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there is this contact.
Fred Demargne: team I'm in a dashboard
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah I think. Yeah. Can you click on it?
Fred Demargne: here
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it takes to the same page.
Fred Demargne: but here you cannot know you cannot I can type a message here so so
 
 
00:28:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it works oh so I am in a user uh I cannot uh invest in a specific investment opportunity. I send this. Yeah. So, it works. So some I would receive it as a as a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, you would. But the thing is to be able to send a message,
Fred Demargne: CEO.
Ghiles Moussaoui: somebody from the CEO side have to send you a message first. So to start a conversation, only the option only gave it to the CEO.
Fred Demargne: Ah, we could say automatically welcome to, you know, we could say
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, there could be. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: welcome to Verso. Um,
Fred Demargne: yeah, just a simple message.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, actually because I'm also changing I'm I'm writing the code for the compliance
Fred Demargne: Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: agent and there is the chat uh agent. So, I have to make AI there and it will be available for all um investors.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, can you uh who who who told you to put this here?
 
 
00:29:29
 
Fred Demargne: The the text on the B. Oh, uh let me share something else. I think uh if we want to launch on Monday, we need to focus now on the small details instead of the compliance agent.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um let me see. laptop is so slow
Ghiles Moussaoui: Heat.
Fred Demargne: now. So that should be this share. So can you see my screen?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, you were in the same screen. If you change pages, I think I can still see it.
Fred Demargne: Okay. But it doesn't say that I'm sharing this page. Normally there is a sign saying I'm sharing this space. Anyway, so that would uh Did Jan told you to to put it like
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, no, not really.
Fred Demargne: this?
Ghiles Moussaoui: No.
Fred Demargne: Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Universal holdings again. It's an old
Fred Demargne: you need to get rid of Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: thing.
Fred Demargne: you need maybe to do a search in all the screens to get rid of allings. Vers needs to have a space between the letters.
 
 
00:30:54
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I don't think here the font is is a Spartan
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's just
Fred Demargne: League.
Ghiles Moussaoui: text.
Fred Demargne: Um I think here it might be confusing because we cannot do investment in real
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: empire. Real fund does not exist anymore.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Should I just remove
Fred Demargne: So I think what we should do here
Ghiles Moussaoui: it
Fred Demargne: trying to think. You see here as well the the the border here is next to the the
Ghiles Moussaoui: sidebar between
Fred Demargne: border of the menu. There should be a space.
Ghiles Moussaoui: them?
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Like you like you did on the other ones.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess it's the same for the featured opportunities as well and the view deals. So basically have a board um a margin between
Fred Demargne: Yeah, there's a margin, the same margin across all the different screens.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.
Fred Demargne: I think that will make it um lean and cleaner.
 
 
00:32:02
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um so if we don't put anything here, I mean the the good thing is is to have this button to contact Verso. Uh, so maybe we can just
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, as action center. So there's an action center which is finish on boarding and just the other one is finish um contact
Fred Demargne: um
Ghiles Moussaoui: verso instead of um the welcome thing or it could be just a message the welcome thing.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, because Julian want there are two options. All we do instead of we keep the same format but instead of putting virtual fun real empire luxe platform we put example of opportunities which are live.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So you keep exactly the same except the borders but you keep exactly the same. The text needs to be the boarding steps.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I mean the text if the user has already on boarded I think the text should be different. Um I think we should have a tagline.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um the title is different here.
 
 
00:33:14
 
Fred Demargne: Investor on boarding doesn't make sense. Um maybe here we should have a tagline for verso tech.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You could you could just send me a screenshot and every um I mean um because I guess there will be other things, right? So you could send me screenshots of specific areas um that you want to change and you tell me below in an email what you need to change and then I think um you can get me many changes like that and it will be easy especially if it is just UI it will be way straightforward for
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: me and
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh
Fred Demargne: So at least on your site can you make sure that there is doesn't holding doesn't appear in any screen and a verso is always with a right font with a space in between
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: the letters.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um just need to think if we because here what I'm what I need the most is a contact versus team.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can just Yeah, I can I can remove that section.
 
 
00:34:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: And if you go down, there is a action center. Um, yeah, these Yeah, that that's what I mean. It goes to the messages inbox. So, same thing. Yeah, that looks like this instead of like this. Then here's the four-step process you need to follow. Step one is find inspiration. You need to go out in the wild, find a web page you want to emulate, take a bunch of screenshots of that web page, and also, this is important, grab the HTML code. We can do this by either hitting F12 or right click, inspect. You're going to go to source styles and copy all this down. Those screenshots in that code is what we're going to use in step two.
Fred Demargne: Chris Google me disconnected
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Weird.
Fred Demargne: So I wanted to ask you if you check whether there is any button who doesn't work in a production.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh buttons that don't work.
Fred Demargne: I'm asking you if you could check this if you can do a script or I don't know if there's
 
 
00:35:52
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: automatic way just to avoid having any button who doesn't work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: Uh here I'm I'm in production here. I'm in production. Yeah, but I'm not as a user and not as an investor. Um, so if if I look here as an investor
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't see a
Fred Demargne: and I know I need time to share my
Ghiles Moussaoui: screen.
Fred Demargne: screen. Oh yeah. I mean I have enough with Google Meet is so bad.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it uh blocked?
Fred Demargne: It's opening and it's closing. It's opening. It's closing. So now you should be able to open it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep.
Fred Demargne: So you see here I am on the dashboard and you already have a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes.
Fred Demargne: button support.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So maybe we don't need
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: anything.
Ghiles Moussaoui: That was a section created with with welcome message when you first sign in because you see nothing in the dashboard.
 
 
00:37:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So there isn't anything right. Um yeah.
Fred Demargne: So here you see you still have virtual holdings
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. I know.
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I know.
Fred Demargne: So if you can do that first of all you know in term of design I will do what you what we discussed. So um but I guess now we are getting to a point where this section can just be deleted.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um but if you could check if there is any repetition of holdings in the in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: page if there is any any action button will release nowhere.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh to review the borders
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: uh the verso take the logo that we discussed. So to get rid of this one here in the middle and to have here in a better quality and to keep it the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: blue if it's black or light or dark.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. You could send me an email.
 
 
00:38:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: You could uh copy paste the email or refer to it because you have a list, right? Which is in notion email template inventory. You could refer to it as the number of the email. The each one has a number 1.3 and until the last one. um and you could tell me the changes that you have done directly to it in an email and they will be able to do the changes when it comes to the UI. Um so the template itself uh I will just use the color blue as you said and uh put the verso logo and uh the cutting thing and everything centered not all the text but uh I mean the text is centered in the middle with some margin and yeah. Hello. Hello. My Chrome to crash completely. So, now I saw the email when you told me it's in notion. So, I will find it. Yeah. Uh, and it's not only the email template, but it's also all the different emails triggered by the platform.
 
 
00:40:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's uh I mean, yeah, if it isn't a template, so it's already, you know, it's triggered by the platform. I included everything that is sent in the platform. Okay. So, if we could focus on that uh tonight and this weekend, it's we finish this small polishing. Yeah. Uh and then data upload for virtual capital too. Yep. And you will see that you have some virtual capital LLC as well. Yeah, I will try to finish it tonight. If not tonight, tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I am able to work in parallel because code in the data is very bit when I run the script it takes compute. So I have to wait sometimes. So I'm able to work on other things. Um so yeah, we'll try to do both. Um one thing I wanted to mention, so asset manager, um I don't know if you have time to review, I could still possibly finish it. If you have time to review the PRD or description I sent to you with the um email templates, it's there.
 
 
00:41:33
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um so which uh which email was it? It's in the notion. If you go to notion, I created a tab to be open. Okay, I will do it like Yeah, I will do it again. Okay. Okay. So, that uh I started the user guides. I did not upload everything in notion but I uploaded many. Um I'm not sure if they are up to date though, but I did start them a couple of I think two weeks ago. Um Okay. I have. So do do you but do you so do you think that with all of this that we have to do do you think realistically that we can be ready to launch on Monday? For sure. Yeah. I mean it depends on the data. if you know if uh there is some back and forth maybe that's could be an issue but uh when it comes to code and stability I think yeah I mean as long as they know what to do I think we will be able to launch on Monday um afternoon or evening for sure okay because now if you know if I go to Julian and tell we're launching on Monday I don't want to say oh no we have a problem that we cannot launch Yeah.
 
 
00:42:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, um I mean I think 930 you have all the data for the uploading. Yeah. So there's nothing that you need to wait for from us at the moment. All the data. Yeah. And then I need to finish couple of things on the testing the basic testing. Yeah. um especially you know testing versus sign with entities and stuff because I was focusing on the document if you corrected a term sheet I correct the layout now there is it send you a message uh last night now it could take more than one page so it takes two pages is that a fine thing I need to I mean If it takes more than one page is because we put a lot of text. It's not because of you. I understand. Yeah. I mean before I think Julian told me some time that we would rather have it at one page. So the last thing that was overlapping was because we added the logo that took some space. So the logo was before in the top right.
 
 
00:43:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now it's in the middle. So that's why. And also some more. Can you can you reduce the leg of the logo so that um we can stick to one page like you try or I mean it can be he can but he can go over one page because then the CEO has always a possibility to you know when he publish when before publishing yeah junior and the PDF and then we can see oh it's two pages so we need to try to reduce the uh the wording but Um, I think it's worth reducing the logos that you know with the text I gave you, uh, they should fit in one page. So, you think the problem is only the logos? Try to reduce them. I mean, it's not reducing. I think we should put it on the top right or something like that because now it's adding length instead of doing it in a place where it's not adding length just on the top right. So it's just you know uh it's like a decoration in a wall in the top right not um as you know the length of the entire document.
 
 
00:45:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Try to understand. Yeah. So if you go to the space X1 or the envelopic preferred deal and you regenerate it, you can check the preview document and you will see what I mean. I can open the one I sent you. Yeah, you have to regenerate it. I mean, you can go to deals and you find it. The the problem was on the previous one already. What do you mean? Why do I need to regenerate it for the I mean, I know there will still be an issue. But if I open the previous one, I said, I guess the logo thing. Okay. You see what I mean? I see. Yeah, it's just logo thinking length. before it was in the top right. So it it was regardless of it wasn't taking anything because there was already the logo of verso and then the text of the term sheet and then the beginning of the tables. It was just beside I'm trying to check if we can if we Yeah.
 
 
00:46:21
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. If you want to put on the left and and the company logo on the right corner, maybe that's without changing the file, it can go on two pages. Uh because then it's up to us to decide if we reduce the text or not. Um but I think I would I would uh yeah, I would put the logo on on both sides. So first on the left, I think there's no need to put it on the left. Um, we can just put it there. But if we put the the other thing on the left or the the right, I mean the right, it's better. As Julian showed me the term sheets before, uh, then it will be fit in well. If we put if we put one on the right, we need to put the other on the left. We can have one in the middle and one on the right. I mean, so I think you need to have on the left. On the third sheets during, they were like that.
 
 
00:47:19
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. I'm watching one. You sure? I can do the video. I'm watching one now. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's correct. I think there was many term sheets design. Oh, that's difficult for you because Julian sometimes he's got to different inspiration. Yeah. So, I think this example I think it would be easier. Yeah. One on the left, one on the right. Okay. Always on the on the left. All right. Yeah, we'll get it done. D has already used it. So, I will put it like this. All right. And I will simplify the layout for you. And but you can take two pages. Uh it's it's it's good for us to be able to to to check before we publish it and to make sure that uh we can reduce the text if we all right makes sense. Yeah. Uh okay I think on the design thing what would be so if I've got some very specific thing I want to change I'll send it to you and take a snapshot and I'll send it to you.
 
 
00:48:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. What will be super helpful is Yes. What will be super helpful is what we discussed tonight if you could send me a quick email just with bullet points to write down you know what you've done you know uh yeah taking out all the check taking out replacing the the logo with text. Yeah, I will send you more later that you know I know what is being done. Yeah. Uh and me what I will do tonight is uh so taking the asset manager that you have the information for you to start working on it. um checking the what we discuss the email templates because we have stuff and then we'll continue testing and we'll do that in that order. Okay. Go ahead. So that you have the information for you to prove best first before I continue my testing. Yeah. And I'm not sure if you're testing with multiple personas or are you sticking to the main ones for now because there's, you know, introducers and arranger. So I didn't prioritize it.
 
 
00:49:59
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: The amount of time I have uh it's a bit complicated. So I'm doing a froggy next week. I'm focusing mostly on the relationship between the investor and the CEO because Julian said this is the most critical. Yeah. Then tomorrow I will start working on the introducer. Okay. But that's why I started to do the same models you know that we discussed yesterday because I wanted to start establishing yeah the links. So then I will create a user as an introducer. Yeah. A separate one. Mhm. So by the way the introducer we haven't corrected it really fully because you use you you are using a model of template that I had as well like Julian provided you with which does not make any reference to the spread. Uh yeah so I use what they sent me last time. Yeah. So I need to I need to find I need to find a way to add a text. Yeah. who makes a reference price but those section needs to appeal if and only if that fee structure applies right performance fee if there is no performance fee yeah I'm not sure if this is applied because last time you sent me the template you sent me one template which did not have the sections dynamic and then you sent me another template um so both have different comments on I will take a look. Can you can you resend me the one I sent you just in case and I will review it or something like um the one you used to to code? So I have a look the one I used to code is the one that you sent me this morning. It was the same one. Um it's the same I sent you in WhatsApp as well I believe. Okay. I didn't check on my WhatsApp for documents. I usually don't don't look. So, but you said in your from your compar was exactly the same. Yeah. There was no comment about what needs to be viable, what needs to be fixed. No, I mean there was another template which is not this one which is another one. But that one did not have any dynamic fees.
