Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello. Hello. Okay. Hello.
Fred Demargne: It is. H sorry I was connected and then I uh I went away from my
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yo.
Fred Demargne: desk. Is everything all right? Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Um, so I I saw the good news yesterday. So what what what happened exactly? Do you know so that we know for the future for VC
Ghiles Moussaoui: for VC. Okay, let me remember.
Fred Demargne: 106?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um uh yeah, it was just I was count I was first to get the um you know 76,000 not um minus 8,000 for uh Simon. So the way I did it is that it it was correct. It just calculated only virtual partner. Um it was supposed to calculate everything in that VC but it was using only virtual partner. Um so yeah the only
Fred Demargne: So there was some commission missing
Ghiles Moussaoui: reason no it
Fred Demargne: before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: was so invers um I mean VC06 most of them is uh VC part I mean virtual partner right
 
 
00:03:56
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah, there's only one which is
Ghiles Moussaoui: exactly so it was calculating only virtual partner the only one that is not uh was
Fred Demargne: not.
Ghiles Moussaoui: causing the discrepancy because it did not
Fred Demargne: No, no, but I was delet I was not taking into account Simony.
Ghiles Moussaoui: calculate.
Fred Demargne: So there was a discrepancy of 46,000. It was not it was not related to Simony.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um but okay then in the dashboard when you sum everything you find the same amount right you find 2,76,000
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Including Simony and when you take out Simony is 2 million68.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Right.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Exactly. That's how I did it as well.
Fred Demargne: But until the last five you sent me in the night, we didn't have 2 million68.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: We had 2,11 or what was it? 2 million1.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh there was something missing in I think the virtual BI
Fred Demargne: But I'm talking about virtual partner here only partner.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah.
 
 
00:05:04
 
Fred Demargne: Let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh let me see. I'm going to make the calculation quickly just in case.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. I think was something was missing. I do not remember where it was added.
Fred Demargne: So first of all, if I add up everything and if I compare to the dashboard, it is the same amount. So VC. So if I take every everything here except Simony and if I had all the subscription fees. s***, it's not the right column. So I add Yeah, here it doesn't matter. So up. So I'm going to add up all the spread. Okay. 2 million 16. No, there's still a gap. f***. Uh, let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there a gap still?
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I thought he was corrected. So, I didn't check. Uh, let me quickly do it now. I'm just going to check if where it is. One second. If I can see it easily.
 
 
00:07:04
 
Fred Demargne: So that's for the performance. No performance here. I don't care. What I care about is the spread of the invested amount. up invested amount and up uh spread them. Okay. So numbers so if I sum everything. So 96 046. So now there is a gap on the invested amount.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And this
Fred Demargne: Did you you didn't correct the the line I told you or did
Ghiles Moussaoui: is
Fred Demargne: you?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know which um line it is. I don't I don't think I
Fred Demargne: I put in my email. It was a row 148.
Ghiles Moussaoui: did.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, you didn't. I think I put in my email and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: yesterday I said I updated the row 148.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 148.
Fred Demargne: So I think if you add this the invested amount is fine but we still have a gap with uh with
Ghiles Moussaoui: this bread.
Fred Demargne: a spread and I think this is exactly the same as before. And if I checked Lee,
 
 
00:08:50
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,
Fred Demargne: so did you you didn't modify league run group.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I removed them as an investor.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: They become introducer.
Fred Demargne: No. So you you remember what I told you yesterday? You put Lee Ran Group and it's not your fault. is because Julian added up the name of the entity but the investor are not is not Lee Ran
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: group. The investor are the individuals next to it but if I open the file you still left Lee ran
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: group.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Maybe the file was not edited, but they they removed um I mean
Fred Demargne: Okay. So for instance the spread for this in for those investors is not correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: rang. Okay.
Fred Demargne: is not aligned with the dashboard,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay then.
Fred Demargne: but it's not the only thing that can explain the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I will sorry.
Fred Demargne: difference.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So lead and group was removed replaced by what exactly?
Fred Demargne: So if you look at the dashboard, let's open the dashboard.
 
 
00:09:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I am there.
Fred Demargne: So if I go to uh So nothing was replaced. It's just that if you look at those lines where you have lean group, this was there before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So it's not your fault. It was there. I'm I'm on it now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I don't know if you can go where I am. It's row 45 for instance.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, it's starting there.
Fred Demargne: So the investor is Atima he's not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, so
Fred Demargne: group it's ecta that is not lean group it's Muhammad bin Muhammad it's not lean group
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I should delete entity.
Fred Demargne: etc.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I should put the investor name instead. Okay.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I missed this. I thought uh I thought it was not supposed to be an investor completely.
Fred Demargne: No, it's you know you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, those is J added that we know that they are coming from the same group
 
 
00:10:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: of from a a commercial discussion he had with the same group of people.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: But eventually who signed the agreement are the names next to it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: And actually the same happened with Edgeabase Security LLC.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Here if you go on the row 56 Ed security LLC is not the investor. Aaron Ricky Lin area and Tapan Sha are the investors.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, what should I do with this as well?
Fred Demargne: So they are individual investors with the name that you have
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. Which which are the name?
Fred Demargne: Aaron Lin Tapan.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Exactly the same thing. It's misleading.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: It's not your fault. It's us. Uh but if I take edge bay so for instance you see were there any fees here let me
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: see no there was no fees here so I don't know where the gap is uh I'm telling you in the lean group you have four rows in your
 
 
00:12:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: spreadsheet and there are more fees than what you have put in the file.
Ghiles Moussaoui: in the Ling
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: group.
Fred Demargne: if I look like let me share my screen so I explain
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Fred Demargne: specifically. Can you see my screen?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So this is a file you sent me. You see len group we have four rows here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: We have a total of fees here of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: 28,549.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. And if I go to the dashboard for this group of of clients, so it's from row 46 to row 53 excluding the row 50. The total fees should be 40,59 and 25.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So here we have a gap of 12,000.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah.
Fred Demargne: So that's why I'm saying I don't know but I think that there is a we are still missing. I don't know if the investors are missing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Therefore, when you collect the information of the fees, then you are missing some investment and some fees associated to the investment.
 
 
00:14:06
 
Fred Demargne: Or if you are missing uh let me see in a subscription spreadsheet. Let me see if I open the last one you sent me. Because maybe the problem is not where we are trying to fix it. Maybe the problem is on the subscription. One second. Somebody is calling. I need to just have a pause for one minute.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem,
Fred Demargne: Coming to check something in my flat.
Ghiles Moussaoui: man.
Fred Demargne: One second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I'm back. So, uh, the last file of subscription you sent me full subscription data. It's here. So if I I'm going to check up VC 106. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I misunderstood the lyan group.
Fred Demargne: What do you mean you misunderstood? You still misunderstood or you mean what we discussed yesterday?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday I do not understand exactly what to do with it.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, I look at the subscription file and you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:16:20
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: For lean
Fred Demargne: have
Ghiles Moussaoui: group.
Fred Demargne: in the file that you had generated to me in a subscription you have six. So you see we are missing we are missing subscription one two three four and no seven 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 So you have a total of 434. No the subscription is correct. Good. So the problem is in the way you uh you get the the the commissions. I don't know whether there's um a format issue or whatever it is but for whatever reason you are not collecting all the fees for lean group.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. All right. I will I'll fix it.
Fred Demargne: Maybe because you know you have you have three subscription of the same amount. Let me share my screen. So maybe that's what's creating the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: problem.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, is it the same date as well?
Fred Demargne: I check I'm going to share my screens. Make sure you understand.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, maybe it's the duplication that didn't do well because
 
 
00:17:47
 
Fred Demargne: So look here you have for lean group you have three
Ghiles Moussaoui: here
Fred Demargne: subscription of the same amount $49989. Uh why some of them have funded amount?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Why do we have zero? Why do I have zero zero here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: The mount uh it was not You remember when you added new to the database it's funed amount is zero after everything is done then I can set all of the status to funded amount the entire value of it. So for a lot of them is done but when I reconcile rerun the script on specific things that were missing then it added that uh being zero.
Fred Demargne: So we need to fix it. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So let me see if now the question you asked me whether the three are in the same date. One, two, three. So two of them are in the same date. Yeah. 16 of February and one is a 15 of February.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: So that's probably one of the issue.
 
 
00:19:07
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. All right. I will spend some time on
Fred Demargne: So you mean when you upload the data the system is probably missing no some
Ghiles Moussaoui: this.
Fred Demargne: commissions because the dates the amount and the investor is the same.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah I think there is some before there was some um dduplication that happened where when it is the same date the same amount the same everything for two rows it be it became one row uh for for example you can see um lean group where I am right now on the dashboard part uh the 49,900 it's on the same
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: date um and there is also the above the above
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: one uh which is also on the same date right so I think
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this made some issues um but the the the fees were not I mean the fees were also the same but probably cut it took only one fee or something like that from the script so I will analyze it and I will make sure it's not uh doing this.
 
 
00:20:25
 
Fred Demargne: Okay. Um, I had a call from Julian this morning and he really want to launch as soon as possible. is now he said to me we need to launch
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: ASAP.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So data consistency is one of the key issue and then I mentioned to him that uh uh we are you are supposed to finalize some code for the versign which we will discuss today uh and the term sheet. Um, is there anything else that uh from the the main functionality? But by the way, did you load in test what we discussed yesterday or not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: yet?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think so. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me check it.
Fred Demargne: I didn't know since you didn't let me know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I didn't. I still did not send you the email. I finished at 2 a.m.
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I slept directly for the missing email as
Fred Demargne: no worries.
Ghiles Moussaoui: well. So, yeah.
 
 
00:21:48
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: um versus sign. I think maybe to to make it perfect, the only thing that is to do is to calibrate a little more the place of the signatures.
Fred Demargne: So you wanted to you said you wanted to do a demo.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I
Fred Demargne: Should we do a demo now and we discuss
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it? So from the different things that we discussed apart from the asset manager and the closing is everything in test.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, there's also a new documents page.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know if it matters. Let me connect my moment. Okay. Wait, let me see my
Fred Demargne: No, I can't see your
Ghiles Moussaoui: screen.
Fred Demargne: screen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No.
Fred Demargne: Now I can see I can see um a mountain, a background of sapphire, you know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you want to test uh locally or should we go to the dev?
Fred Demargne: I would prefer that we do a test because that's where I'm going to test afterwards.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Fred Demargne: If you if you if you put it in test already.
 
 
00:23:39
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see my screen?
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: see
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh,
Fred Demargne: there's also the emails that we need to change.

Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah. The email templates. I did send you a list. Yeah. uh with the asset manager explanation. Um I know there is like a holdings in many temps to be removed but I'm not sure about the copy the other copy. So I did not touch it for now. So yeah that needs to be changed for
Fred Demargne: When when did you send me the templates?
Ghiles Moussaoui: sure.
Fred Demargne: Do you remember? So there below so the email template could you send me the email on last Monday and you sell you said the email templates and the asset manager breakdown in notion.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah, I put them in notion. So when you go to notion uh when you go
 
 
00:24:54

Fred Demargne: All right. Here you email templates I suppose. Let me open the tasks.
Ghiles Moussaoui: and users user guides. If you remember, I started it. I don't think I put the uh the the new ones though. Where is it?
Fred Demargne: There's in the command board you have a email template and asset
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: manager.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And uh yeah,
Fred Demargne: So you send me the email
Ghiles Moussaoui: user guides.
Fred Demargne: templates.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's all
Fred Demargne: Let's go here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: there.

Ghiles Moussaoui: uh the document. So email categories first email is staff invitation 1.1 then investor invitation 1.2 to the table for the fields and the value and uh the content professional
Fred Demargne: Because I am in I am in the inside the the tasks where you say document purpose client
Ghiles Moussaoui: partneration.
Fred Demargne: review of automated email sent by virtual platform in
 
 
00:26:35
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Where are you?
Fred Demargne: um let me share my screen. So you see email template inventory and you put email
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.

Ghiles Moussaoui: No.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, I I need to review all the emails.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Or you could write them if you if you think it takes more time. You could write them uh new ones and uh it'll be the
Fred Demargne: Yeah. But I think I know. But you didn't invent them.
Ghiles Moussaoui: same.
Fred Demargne: No, you you you presented them to J at some point.
 
 
00:28:13
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I know um not all of them. No,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: since before it was the investor portal if you remember and the staff portal. So a lot of things changed. A lot of notifications did not exist. Uh but they were created from the user stories. So a lot of it uh is not there.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So can you see my screen?
Fred Demargne: Looks like
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Um,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I have one issue in the UI I did not fix yet, but I will fix it today. I left it pending, but it's not here. So, what I've done yesterday, I created virtual capital 2 series 700 investment of investment called E2B test company secondary. So, this is a vehicle I created. I just added basic information. um like this
Fred Demargne: What is reporting
Ghiles Moussaoui: reporting type not required.
Fred Demargne: type?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um I did not put it. So it's a basically the if you remember the public versus the corporate thing where you send them an email and you wait your info or you search online.
 
 
00:29:35
 
Fred Demargne: But if you put requires reporting, yes, it doesn't uh it doesn't trigger anything. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, not yet. No, it's not set the agent. It's not triggerable uh for now. So, yeah, I just added this basic information and then I went to deals. I created a new deal, E2E complete test deal.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, when I go inside Um I have okay so basic information here uh fundrisising progress here basic information close date is all basic which I can edit from here but I did not put the close date and open date and then I created a term
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: sheet. So here uh term sheet I created basic information. So two for example is like this unless you edit
Fred Demargne: Perfect. It's
Ghiles Moussaoui: it. Uh issuer looks like this.
Fred Demargne: perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Vehicle I change it but it should be virtual capital and then series at the end instead of this purchaser. Um yeah and then arranger legal council seller the price per share cost per share minimum ticket the fees uh and can put waved here or something.
 
 
00:31:19
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Capital call timeline completion um date text there's a date here and in principle approval text subscription pack node and there's this this does not change and I can regenerate the document Okay. So document looks like this now. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So this is the same format. Which format did you use in the end? The one Julian sent you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What for?
Fred Demargne: The temp sheet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I send I use a template you showed me last time and we discussed.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Are you sure there was vehicles or vehicle?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh it's vehicle, not vehicles. Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So that is need to be changed. Sheet field vehicles becomes vehicle. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if you want to take a look.
Fred Demargne: Now maybe what I'm going to do is I'm going to do one example and I will
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: send for to Julian for confirmation.
 
 
00:33:03
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Great. Okay.
Fred Demargne: Just the logo doesn't seem again you know the logo I don't know if you remember we discussed it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this. Yeah. Um, Spartan League league
Fred Demargne: Yeah, that's correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Spartan.
Fred Demargne: But isn't isn't there too much space between the letters?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can put it condensed if you
Fred Demargne: Let me Normally, it's supposed to to have a space,
Ghiles Moussaoui: want.
Fred Demargne: an additional space, but it feels like there's way too much. Let me just check one. I sent you So template here. Yeah, you see it's it's let me share now it says
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: vehicles with an S.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you as well use the
Fred Demargne: Yeah, in my template as well. Um, let me see what Julian sent you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: vehicle?
Fred Demargne: If I check, let me open a recent term sheet. It's weird. One second here. The term sheet. Yeah, you put with an S.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
 
 
00:35:01
 
Fred Demargne: So um if I share my screen now you will see how verso should look like. Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think it's from the
Fred Demargne: look,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I understand.
Fred Demargne: there is an extra space, but you see it's not exactly the same as you have
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,
Fred Demargne: Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's a way I think it's the HTML that uh does this and also the format of the uh document if it is
Fred Demargne: what?
Ghiles Moussaoui: letter A5 or um A4 uh when it turns from the HTML to PDF. So I will take a look into this fix logo for the other docs as
Fred Demargne: Okay. Can you show me again the term sheet that you have just for me to have a quick look?
Ghiles Moussaoui: well.
Fred Demargne: I will stop sharing transaction type opportunity. Sure vehicles. Yeah. Go down. Um exclusive arranger purchaser set structure allocation price per share. Yeah. Minimum ticket. Yeah. Go down. Management fee carried interest legal council interest confirmation.
 
 
00:36:51
 
Fred Demargne: I think here we need interest confirmation. There needs to be a free text. It's not it's not just a date. If you if interest if you look at the template I sent you there was a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Where?
Fred Demargne: text capital.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah. Okay,
Fred Demargne: So go back to the preview. Yeah, preview capital completion there in
Ghiles Moussaoui: good.
Fred Demargne: principles there change date indicative terms should expire on here you need to say so the last one vality date you need to say not only December 12 2026 but you need to add after that uh at 5:00 pm luxembburg
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um let me check how it is done. Valid detail. Okay. So you want to add 5:00 p.m. all the
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: time.
Fred Demargne: Luxembourg time. We need to say 5:00 pm Luxembourg to know which time zone you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: are. No, just for validity date you usually put it on because it's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:38:26
 
Fred Demargne: important you know if you have to if an offer is no longer valid it needs to be very
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: clear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, she changes
Fred Demargne: So if I go in more detail now I think so date if you go back up uh just to see to a list also logo needs to be adjusted indicative term sheet uh why did you put it in capital letters I think it was not in
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. Isn't
Fred Demargne: capital letters let me see if I open a recent one yeah it's not a capital letter so Then going
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.
Fred Demargne: back. Yeah, you see it's exactly so it's not in capital letter.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So, so let's go back. So, yeah. No, don't go too fast. So, date. So, date up, please. Okay. Date is okay. Two is perfect. Uh trans type is okay. So this is a free text. No secondary market purchase.
 
 
00:39:54
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Opportunity. All right. Issuer. All right. Uh vehicles. All right. Right. Exclusive aranger. Exclusive aranger. What was the message? Regulated by BVI FSC. Okay. And you need to put into brackets ARER
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. I think
Fred Demargne: like you have in a in a model in a in a template. You need to put this as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: Also then uh purchaser the same comment you need to put the bracket
Ghiles Moussaoui: Understood.
Fred Demargne: seller the same comment structure uh structure you put share of common stock but it's a it's a free text or it's an option
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's an option either way.
Fred Demargne: the structure Structure should be a free text. Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it again please to
Fred Demargne: After seller, you have purchaser, seller, structure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: invest in? Yeah, this should be this all the time or should it be customizable?
 
 
00:41:22
 
Fred Demargne: It will be customizable.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay, then it's uh probably customizable. Last time I only put uh what is need when what needs to be put as document. See this is why I probably forgot the 5mm Luxmbourg. It was in the second page did not extract
Fred Demargne: So allocation what did you put up to?
Ghiles Moussaoui: well.
Fred Demargne: Up to okay I think that's okay. Then price per share that's okay. Minimum ticket that's okay. Then the fees. So it depend on the fees. Yeah. So 2%.
Ghiles Moussaoui: here there is
Fred Demargne: You are missing the you're missing the subscription
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh um
Fred Demargne: fee. Is it because you didn't put any or is because the template is
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah I think let me
Fred Demargne: missing?
Ghiles Moussaoui: check. Oh, the template is probably missing. So, probably in the HTML template management. Yeah, the HTML template. So, I will add that here. Um, I think I I did something that caused to it to be gone, which is the wave thing here.
 
 
00:42:49
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: What does it mean? When do I write this? And when is it just
Fred Demargne: So wave is when you have zero.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 2%.
Fred Demargne: So if in the subscription fee or management fee or carried interest we put zero instead of writing zero in the document you put waved instead
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: of and the 2% that you have here for subscription fee 2% peranum and 20% no other rate uh no cap those are the uh standard terms that we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: have.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this is default 28 and 20.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So this is missing subscription fee.
Fred Demargne: So when you when the system see that we entered zero instead of putting zero you should
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: see you should write
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: this
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand. I will do it.
Fred Demargne: legal council. Let me see if you go back to the legal council.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And
Fred Demargne: Uh Tesla Nexenburg. Okay. So
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is because I selected um one that is named like
 
 
00:43:56
 
Fred Demargne: here
Ghiles Moussaoui: this.
Fred Demargne: okay in theory we need to put Julian added a lead console into brackets between the so I don't know if it's complicated for you to add
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. No,
Fred Demargne: this but
Ghiles Moussaoui: no, no. Uh, all of this it doesn't take much um time. So here partner law from Luxmbourg council should it be this the most of the time but you will be able to change it.
Fred Demargne: You mean Dupon partner? No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think the best is what you did. So the CEO needs to select in the lawyer because we might work with more
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: lawyers now with the platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So then you have so you should go back interest confirmation I think you are missing some text
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: here um then
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. You told me
Fred Demargne: you have capital what was the text that I gave you slightly
Ghiles Moussaoui: No letter. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So here you should put like you did for qualified investor, you put a standard text and that the CEO can adjust
 
 
00:45:24
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: if he wants to.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Get it then.
Fred Demargne: Completion date. Where does this text come from? It was from a previous term sheet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, previous name she not this one. I think this one should be only date if I'm not
Fred Demargne: Uh yeah, completion date. Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: wrong.
Fred Demargne: before we put only a date, but if Julian wants to have some free text, I think you should you should add the free text after that. So don't put target completion, just put by and then the date and then there is a free text which could be empty.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, I understand. So in one row there should be two fields. First the date by and then uh text if it is not empty then it should I mean yeah if it's not empty then it will be here. If it's not then it will be deleted or not showed.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, thanks.
Fred Demargne: So in principle approval should be a free text predefined if you want
 
 
00:46:33
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: and the co can change. Then you have subscription pack the same free text because imagine might word it differently from one deal to the next.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: share certificates the same subject to change the same and then the validity date what we discussed so normally it's indicative
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: term should expires on that's perfect the date and then you need to put 5:00 p.m. and Luxembourg for the time
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: zone
Ghiles Moussaoui: makes sense. So, yeah, major issue here. I missed the subscription
Fred Demargne: subscription fee.
Ghiles Moussaoui: fee.
Fred Demargne: I don't know. It was not mapped out.
Ghiles Moussaoui: H
Fred Demargne: It doesn't seem to be mapped out because we you add you put uh you inserted 2% subscription fee. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: probably a mapping uh or something.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's HTML probably. Yesterday was the first time I was testing it. So yeah, this doesn't take much time. I will fix it.
 
 
00:47:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So the logo um the free text.
Fred Demargne: try to stick to the document I sent you uh as much as you can.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: If you have any question, give me a quick call and which we can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now for this I think it's pretty clear. I just did not test it um before I generated this one.
Fred Demargne: No worries.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should be fine. Okay.
Fred Demargne: Vers. Let's do vers.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So after Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You wanted to show me something.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So after I did this, I'm I'm walking you through what I've done yesterday.
Fred Demargne: Okay, go ahead.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um sorry,
Fred Demargne: No, go ahead. It's a good idea.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I added a new member, which is this one as an investor. And so I went through the I need to show you the subscription pack. But what I've done is I went through the generation it created an approval which I accepted. The approval right now looks like this. So data room access request.
 
 
00:48:49
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh when it comes to the data room and then this uh for the deal I did not remove this status overdue. If you want me to remove it, I
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: can
Fred Demargne: it's not it's not a big deal. I think you understand we need to go launch quickly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: fast. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So try not to change too many things in two different places but it's not
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: critical.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uhhuh.
Fred Demargne: So here so just just sorry here you are a CEO.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um. Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So remember we discussed uh about changing the data room request uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: interest confirmed. Did you change this as well?
Ghiles Moussaoui: data room request. Yeah. So, it was before um deal interest, now it's data room access request.
Fred Demargne: So the the investor requested access and it doesn't show interest
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: confirmed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you mean?
Fred Demargne: before when I was clicking on I want to request access data room.
 
 
00:49:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: It was telling me that I was I was uh interest was confirmed as a as an
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, but this is not investor.
Fred Demargne: investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: When insurance is confirmed, then you will have access to the NDA directly.
Fred Demargne: No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean you will have to sign the NDA. If if interest was approved, you will get notification and then you will have to sign the NDA.
Fred Demargne: after what? Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: After this is approved, the NDAs will be generated for each signatory and then the signature request will be created for CEO. CEO signs which creates
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I was talking about something else. I was saying that when you click on data on require room access the in
Ghiles Moussaoui: which
Fred Demargne: the user interface not in the co interface it says that interest confirmed and it was wrong.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. So, the text there.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Um,
Fred Demargne: If you connect as a as a user that you
 
 
00:50:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't remember.
Fred Demargne: created.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Interest. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I I see what you mean. So, it's the vocabulary. It's uh Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So
Ghiles Moussaoui: In the opportunity page. I don't remember if I changed that though.
Fred Demargne: because I mentioned to you the interest is when you express an interest to invest an
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: amount.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. It was supposed to become data room. Um it will use data room wording there. So yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And
Fred Demargne: Sign. Show me. And you wanted to show me what you did.
Ghiles Moussaoui: basically
Fred Demargne: Yes. So, we were in that room. Request access.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh yeah so I requested access and then it generated the documents. I signed them already. The documents look like this. So if I go to documents page.
Fred Demargne: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Ventures and
 
 
00:52:16
 
Fred Demargne: Okay. So normally the NDA I think I mentioned it but obviously we have many
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: things the the NDA is supposed to be stored um under the investment
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It is uh just the way that I structured this to be able to see all documents. So if you want to be the entire structure, you go vehicle and under vehicle,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you go uh compartment
Fred Demargne: The 700. The 700. No, you created the 700.
Ghiles Moussaoui: and yep
Fred Demargne: So, let's let's go.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 700 and then uh here directly it shows all the documents and there's
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 700. But then if you go to the deal rooms uh if in this deal right there is nothing in the data rooms but if you go to participants there is one participant under here you will find all the documents that have been generated under that um specific person and there is okay these term sheets uh have been created. Oh,
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I see an issue.
 
 
00:53:31
 
Fred Demargne: so this is a
Ghiles Moussaoui: And yeah, yeah, this should be deleted.
Fred Demargne: NA
Ghiles Moussaoui: Forgot it. This page should be deleted. So, Zoho uh Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Do you use sign?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Fred Demargne: Do we use the
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, no, I use internal. So,
Fred Demargne: sign?
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is how the signature is printed. That's what I wanted to show you. This is the calibration that is needed to be changed. What do you think?
Fred Demargne: so that it goes above the the row. You mean?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: just a little bit here.
Fred Demargne: That way it's nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: But did you did you add a stamp somewhere know somewhere in the document like do sign does or
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: not? Did you add I'm sorry I didn't check versus sign yet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Dr.
Fred Demargne: So I need to go into details. Um, did you create a a a code stamp in the document or not?
 
 
00:54:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: What does it mean? A constant
Fred Demargne: So, let me show you the docuign document. One second. Maybe we don't need to. I'm just asking to know. I don't know what uh how Julian briefed you on this. I'm just going to take any document that we have recently.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: One second. So, I think there's only one column on each page. So, I'll show you to share my screen. So this is a document sign by um with docu sign. So you see docu sign create this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay. Uh, no, it's it's like stored inside the database for me.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, do I need to do
Fred Demargne: No, no, no. I mean, if J didn't tell you to do it,
Ghiles Moussaoui: it?
Fred Demargne: let's not uh you know, the message is we need to launch ASAP. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I don't want uh because we had lots of issues uh to figure out what we're going to do with this.
 
 
00:56:14
 
Fred Demargne: And then the signature, you see here, you have a stamp here next to the signature 71
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: D0. Listen, if Jan Toyo is not necessary,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: we don't do it. I don't want to change this now. So, just um yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: check the the calibration. Um and then there's this Zo message on the top.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Show me show me the document the full document. Just uh if you go from the top,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I have one issue here.
Fred Demargne: tell me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Zoho should be removed.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Okay. You see the verso is better here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: Look.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. Yeah, I'm aware.
Fred Demargne: So maybe you can use this um as a for the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: HTML for the other
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: file.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. So this is the series this is the
Fred Demargne: Here you have a repetition. No,
 
 
00:57:14
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: name virtual capital versus capital.
Fred Demargne: it's it's not correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes correct. I I feel like I did not change the HTML template in n because when I create it in the code it does not update automatically here. So I I need to check that uh if the HTML template is up to date because the issues I'm not supposed to have are also the this page the second page that does not have data. Yeah, I feel like I'm using an old version for sure. So I will take a look into this. Yeah, in my memory this was deleted before. If you remember last time we discussed the NDA Um this was not an issue. This was also not an issue. The issue was uh yeah represented by was missing because there was no data. But now I fixed it and yeah this was
Fred Demargne: You have a you have a page uh pagination issue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: present.
Fred Demargne: If you go back,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah there is a missing page.
Fred Demargne: go up.
 
 
00:58:27
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean it's uh
Fred Demargne: It's just because the footer is uh taking is going to the next page. I think it's a problem with the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: footer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So this is HTML issue. I think it was fixed before. So if you don't see any other discrepancies that I can maybe change uh the actual
Fred Demargne: Show me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: document.
Fred Demargne: So go a little bit less fast. You are scrolling a bit too fast for me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Go back uh towards where the page was missing. Okay. So discussing party the table was like this. It was uh it was multiple tables inside a big table.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh no. Um so the HTML this no it's just designwise it's put like this because okay so party but it's just structured in a table way. I can remove it if it's not if
Fred Demargne: I mean it's I don't want to create but you can stick to what we because you know Julian is I don't
 
 
00:59:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: need.
Fred Demargne: think it's critical let's be honest but uh that's you know Julian is used to use a format so I think in general it's better to try to keep the same format Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: if you can find it. I personally don't think it's critical, but you see it's Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: table format.
Fred Demargne: I think it's probably better to try to stick to that if it's not too much of a pain.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Just, you know, sometime when you're used to something is uh you to be lean like
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand.
Fred Demargne: this clean. It's very subjective, so it's not a big
Ghiles Moussaoui: No. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: deal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this it does not you know it's like one singular thing the HTML template. So it's very easy to work on it and make it work very well.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: When I create stuff you see the issues a lot of them raise because I work in bulk and don't look into the details to get it done quickly.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
 
 
01:00:42
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh but yeah so this page is
Fred Demargne: you're going down. So let me see if there's any other problems. So where has indicated part above desire? Okay, go down slowly. One, two. Yeah, the pagionation looks fine. Three. Yes. Continue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is one issue here I believe which is there is a small line cutting um the text if I zoom in.
Fred Demargne: Oh yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you see
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it?
Fred Demargne: Yeah. It's very light, but yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So I think
Fred Demargne: But is it the question is is it the rendering or is it the file if you if you
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, it's the rendering. It's the HTML template. Uh, I think I have
Fred Demargne: download the file and open in PDF in Adobe maybe you don't have this
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, no, no. I think it's the HTML the way it's rendered. Um,
Fred Demargne: okay you see as well here among other things in the one among other
 
 
01:01:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: because it will
Fred Demargne: things there's something The fourth line of the first paragraph here you see among other things financial statement there's kind of a a white it seems to be a color thing. No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Where is it? The fourth page among other things.
Fred Demargne: you don't see that there's a bit of a white uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's a cutting thing.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I I think the HTML template that is used is the old one. That is my guess. But yeah, I will take I will spend some time and test it. Uh should be fine by the end of the day. So all what what we discussed today should be done by the end of the
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: day.
Fred Demargne: But please I mean I understand last night you were super tired. I don't have an issue but please do let me know when it's submitted in test so I can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: test myself you know um can you just show me the process
 
 
01:02:43
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uhhuh. Yes.
Fred Demargne: of signing once that I when I do it I it's going to be
Ghiles Moussaoui: So after that what I've done is created an approval for the subscription pack uh from the investor and then I I did not sign it. I accepted it which created in this one. So counter signature subscription the deal name the the basically the date here as well created and the investor and the amount here uh review counter sign deal as Julian. So by default it is created for Julian only. So if it is not Julian this cannot be signed. So you can see it as a person in the CEO view but you cannot sign. Only Julian can sign and when you click on on sign. So I I changed I feel like I think I changed it to CTL at verso I think. So I can change it. I can sign it I mean and when you click on it you see this and open in web view you can see the document.
 
 
01:03:59
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it's missing the logo here but this is how the subscription pack looks
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: like uh all around. But I I feel like we need to sign where
Fred Demargne: I think there's some I think there's some pagination issue. I need to check it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: where
Fred Demargne: You see here the signature this up
Ghiles Moussaoui: here oh I think yeah I think it's a way that uh the the signature is written um maybe because wait here it's only one
Fred Demargne: You know the the instruction look the instructions of the bank here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: person.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. in a you can you can you don't need to have a such a space in between the the rows. You can have something which is more like a normal line
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: spacing and you will gain some space and thanks to this you will be able
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. No. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: maybe to fit in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. For me, when I created this,
Fred Demargne: signature.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I I focused on the signature places, right?
 
 
01:05:01
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: to make sure they are I told you last time it was the big work because there is a lot of text I did
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: not focus on making sure um the text was correctly you know calibrated and because we I don't have the template I created it myself um but yeah so
Fred Demargne: You don't have the temp you have the Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: um exactly yeah so I use that
Fred Demargne: you don't have the template, but you have example that Julian gave you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: we discussed this last time as
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. Remember, I didn't want to create more confusion. So, I prefer that you stay you stick to this. Uh, okay. I just see a couple of things. If you go up in the definition, there's a definition um section. Go up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up much higher up.
 
 
01:05:50
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah yeah yeah here it's not supposed you're not supposed to show the borders of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: table.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So no borders here. It's end to end.
Fred Demargne: Yeah I mean it's it's a table like this is just taking out the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: borders.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand. Okay.
Fred Demargne: It's just for those definition section not for not in general but for this we don't uh we don't show the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: borders
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. So yeah, then I will be able to sign see sign
Fred Demargne: the sign. Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: like this. This is done. So hopefully now I can go to the arrangers. Uh and then I go to vers as well. Yeah. So here it's called the I think I put I put you there as a person.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh so freed the money. But let me as well sign here.
Fred Demargne: the signing as should not have changed because it says still CEO test.
 
 
01:07:09
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you
Fred Demargne: Okay, let's go to the investor now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: mean?
Fred Demargne: You'll see I'll I'll tell you to stop if you
Ghiles Moussaoui: So I told you the UI in the beginning was a little bit uh wrecked in uh here. I was working on it. So when I go investment opportunity and then the last one I created the progress bar is a little bit weird but I will fix it today. Yeah. What I wanted to do is uh have two routes instead of one. We discussed it previously. Instead of ongoing end to end, it starts with received feud and then there is two ways request access to NDA uh and then and then data room and then pack or directly subscription direct subscription and then direct pack right but the UI did
Fred Demargne: But simply you need look you need to simplify your life because you're making it too
Ghiles Moussaoui: not
Fred Demargne: complicated. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: What is important is if you he needs to view the term sheet then he needs to
 
 
01:08:16
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: uh confirm it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean it does not take
Fred Demargne: I think instead of getting those the data room is just a step.
Ghiles Moussaoui: much.
Fred Demargne: It's not really critical. What is important between viewed and and subscription pack is interest confirmed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I think you should simplify your life. Don't uh don't make it that there are two different journey. No, what is important is before we generate the subscription pack, the the the investor needs to confirm how much he wants to invest.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: That's interest confirmed. So just have between viewed and subscription pack one uh state which is um interest confirmed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I feel like it's better if I finish this. What do you think? Because I started it. It's just UI wise the code works, right?
Fred Demargne: No, but I think it's not I think it's going to be confusing depending on where you go from which journey you go to.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I
Fred Demargne: I think the data room the fact that you access data room is not relevant.
 
 
01:09:23
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: mean it ends. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: What is relevant is whether you confirm how much you want to
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's not. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: invest.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that happens uh when you submit um the subscription, right? So the subscription.
Fred Demargne: So you should call it interest confirmed or
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, I understand.
Fred Demargne: interest.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: So you are just saying I I am interested to invest $1 million. That's what is important and then whether you go through that or not because maybe
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: sometime we will not have data room I don't know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So don't focus on that room in in that uh in that uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry, that's what I mean, right? When there is no data room, the the the flow does not go there. So, previously it was 111. So, these and then there is uh you know request data room and then um sign NDA and then data room and then sub uh subscribe you know. So, in um confirm uh amount
 
 
01:10:26
 
Fred Demargne: No, I remember I remember perfectly the conversation. I'm just trying to tell you that accessing data room is not a critical step.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So I would prefer you you have viewed and then you have interest and then don't say pack
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: gen but say subscription pack then
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yep.
Fred Demargne: um I think the sent I mean it's up to you if you want to leave it because who sends to whom here what do you mean here subscription
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean the the system sends them subscription back to sign. So this
Fred Demargne: but what is it relevant for investor I think it's the your pack has been generated and
Ghiles Moussaoui: is
Fred Demargne: and ready for you to sign. That's what I think it's just one stage that we need and then once it's ready to sign the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: next stage is it's signed then it's funded it's correct and then it's uh active. Yes. So I think you should have only one stage for pack for the subscription pack.
 
 
01:11:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. I understand.
Fred Demargne: So show me the virtual sign for this so I can tell you where my
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when I go to see uh here and then I click to the the
Fred Demargne: question
Ghiles Moussaoui: task and scroll down I see the um signatures the tasks. So at the end there is these two right sign subscription pack real and s. So when I go here click on it uh Uh, it's like this. I can view the document before I sign. So, it's a document they showed you.
Fred Demargne: That's perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Then it's fine.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, it's not exactly the same uh interface as before. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, the document is not showing as preview,
Fred Demargne: That's good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: but uh yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Why did you make it different?
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, it was just when I created it. Uh, bulk creation, make sure it works. And then the details I left it for when we test, you know.
 
 
01:12:33
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this and then I can put the the task here as continued. I can finish it or I can put it as done.
Fred Demargne: By the way,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know.
Fred Demargne: why why do you need If it's signed, it should be
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: completed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I did not work on this page uh fully really.
Fred Demargne: So once the investor sign what happened for the CEO it gets
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um let me so first now I signed as Gas right I am
Fred Demargne: notified.
Ghiles Moussaoui: lo uh logged in as Gas but I think when I go sign with Sara for example it will not allow me to sign it will tell me you're not authorized to sign as this right so I need to change it quickly Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think I think instead of giving this message, you should just not display the possibility to see it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think uh it's it's natural for a user not to be able to sign for somebody else.
 
 
01:13:45
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I think you just you should just prevent this page to open.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh I mean this will open but it will block it. The reason it's open for now it's because this is I made it on a investor scope right investor scope which means all the signatures when you sign
Fred Demargne: Uh-huh.
Ghiles Moussaoui: in uh if you have one account for example you sign in you see all the signatures right but you can only sign your own you cannot sign your other partners.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh so you have to they have to either receive an email for that or you have to do it yourself I mean uh sorry tell them to create an account once they create an account then they can sign
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right so that's how it is done so now I changed it in the code when I submit it will work in the database I mean uh the person yeah so this is sign sign um this this should be disappearing directly Okay. Uh yes.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
 
 
01:14:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Then I go to documents. See here test E2 think created. When I go in there is two subscription NDIS were created for both the signatories with the CEO uh here. So two of them in the agreement. The agreement looks like this. Uh yeah and yeah. So here's the signature. This is the the issue. I think it can be calibrated way more at this end. Makes more sense. And when I scroll down, there is this um here's the issue.
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This Alexander Mula uh needs to be changed. I think dynamic, right?
Fred Demargne: But if he's a CEO, the CEO is called Alexander Miller.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, this uh from um it it did
Fred Demargne: Well, show me the P. Show me the page above.
Ghiles Moussaoui: not.
Fred Demargne: Okay, this is uh let me see the pack uh subscribe. I think here this is not the investor signing. Let me
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hey,
Fred Demargne: see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I have uh the signatures I have right now is arranger um CEO and the party of the investor.
 
 
01:16:11
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but the the the page that you are showing me the CEO is signing not not investor here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: This page is be supposed to be signed by the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: CEO.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Alex and Am is just a field that not put dynamic, but I I will fix it so it's not a problem.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And when I scroll down, uh,
Fred Demargne: So here by the way look if you go above this this needs to be in the center
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is
Fred Demargne: the yeah this needs to be centered.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this.
Fred Demargne: But I look at
Ghiles Moussaoui: Are you sure in the ter
Fred Demargne: it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh
Fred Demargne: Go to your email if you want to your file. Yeah, you'll see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah, true. Okay. Centered understand. So vers two. CS uh something. The page is the page number important. Okay. So now it's not here.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. But um Julie represented by its general partner should be centered in the middle.
 
 
01:17:56
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. All right. And then I scroll
Fred Demargne: Here you've got some pagenation issue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: down
Fred Demargne: You see all the the numbering are not the numbering and not
Ghiles Moussaoui: space.
Fred Demargne: the you see if you go below A B C D. Go ahead. It should be I think uh by the border of the paragraph. No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: like
Fred Demargne: no, no.
Ghiles Moussaoui: here
Fred Demargne: I mean that the text on the the margin on the left if you go up go up go up here I think there is a problem here you
Ghiles Moussaoui: this I don't know these are
Fred Demargne: know and go above go
Ghiles Moussaoui: under this
Fred Demargne: above you see here you have
Ghiles Moussaoui: this oh it's sub
Fred Demargne: okay I need to
Ghiles Moussaoui: subcategory yeah and then you scroll down for signatures yeah here it's not the same but I think it's not also categories but okay this signature page follows okay so subscriber presented by authorizing not to re. So name
Fred Demargne: So here you don't you don't need to say authorize senator one.
 
 
01:19:14
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: this.
Fred Demargne: You just may represent it
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: by
Ghiles Moussaoui: represented by Okay. And then the name of the person.
Fred Demargne: No, the name is below. It's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it makes sense.
Fred Demargne: okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And then this. And then this. Yeah, this is C and a ranger. another page.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the the reason there is space here I think is because when there is multiple signatories it
Fred Demargne: That's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: well.
Fred Demargne: This is That's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the calibration here is only in the first page I believe and then in the appendex there is no signatures as you told me last time should be removed.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I feel like that the the the font size is not the same across all pages.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know uh really I can spend some time to perfect it a little more.
Fred Demargne: I mean I can give you all the all the can I change myself if I see a pro because if I
 
 
01:20:18
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh
Fred Demargne: see a problem of pagionation or stuff is there a way I can fix it because maybe it will be a better
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. Um.
Fred Demargne: use of your time not to focus on
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. What you could do is download the code from GitHub and you will have the HTML
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: templates. So GitHub I mean uh okay GitHub but the what takes time is the testing right? So when you change the HTML you have to test it and the testing which
Fred Demargne: There you go.
Ghiles Moussaoui: means you will have to for the NDA the moment you did it through one investor you have to either clean the database so you can redo it right or you have to create another deal for that investor or another investor then you have to approve it and then you have to go
Fred Demargne: that
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh log into both port you know both ends of the portal sign form both. So the testing takes some time.
Fred Demargne: it's up to you.
 
 
01:21:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um
Fred Demargne: It was just a suggestion. Um because you know I will be probably it would be faster for me to
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: review the document. Maybe maybe I can review it and I can send you the comment some on the in a way and then you implement it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uhhuh. I can do what I can do again is uh the uh I can send you every time I will update the documents and I will send you another version. I will retest it and send you another version if uh works for
Fred Demargne: Okay, let's do that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you.
Fred Demargne: Let's do that and I will send you my comments on
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. All right.
Fred Demargne: it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah. So when you go to the repository, you scroll down, you can see here NDA template HTML, there is the certificate template HTML, introducer agreement template HTML. And when I go to Verso Verso sign, there is here term sheet template HTML and subscription pack HTML.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
 
 
01:22:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So this one is a little bit heavy. has a lot of sticks. Yeah, it has,300 lines of ML.
Fred Demargne: Nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, I think it's faster for me to do it. Um,
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. Okay. So, this is
Fred Demargne: And how is the document called when it's uh signed?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry,
Fred Demargne: How do you call the documents after the pack is signed?
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh, the draft to will disappear normally and then you just have okay subscription pack this I think with date uh is date important as like a
Fred Demargne: Yeah, it would be good to have the date.
Ghiles Moussaoui: reference
Fred Demargne: I think uh normally it's the format is put we put the name of the the acronym of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: we see
Fred Demargne: vehicle. So VC700 then we put subscription
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay
Fred Demargne: pack then we put the usually the company that
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: is the deal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: if you could send me the the the naming pattern, I will rename it.
 
 
01:23:49
 
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This doesn't take time at all. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, yeah, this is for the signature. Uh let me see if I can show you in introducer agreement. Maybe here. I'm not sure if it is the one that is. Yeah, probably is. So yeah, subscri introducer agreement looks like this. So there's a reference number which is the date I believe 2026 0 12 8 something 8. Okay. 28 01 28 28 and 001. Can you see my screen?
Fred Demargne: No, let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is introducer agreement.
Fred Demargne: I can see
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So there's a reference the date in the beginning and then 001 for like number one and then date uh introduction data here. No circum uh circumvention. So this is all the same same this is one maybe issue the table is cutting and then execution the
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: signature is done well I think calibration as well for each signatory but this is introduc agreement for now
 
 
01:25:51
 
Fred Demargne: Mhm. Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: me.
Fred Demargne: that's good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. No, this one. Yeah, I think this is the latest version. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So latest version is this sub signatures look like this. Uh yeah. Okay. So this is done. This is named
Fred Demargne: correctly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh
Fred Demargne: We should put capital. I think we should Yeah, we should change the name of the file.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. Yeah. If you could send me the pattern. I mean I have the pattern for the introducer agreement but I thought this the template pattern. So yeah that's for the documents and versign works like that. Um so I have a couple of action points on my end. I will send you right way. I'm actually send it right now. The missing missing there is 85 for both investor and introducer.
Fred Demargne: is what? 85. What?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Missing emails.
Fred Demargne: still.
 
 
01:27:31
 
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, can you send me the the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: extract?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's this one.
Fred Demargne: Did you send it to me?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: Didn't receive it. That was last
Ghiles Moussaoui: I just No,
Fred Demargne: night.
Ghiles Moussaoui: no. Right now. So, yeah. 86 or 85. 85 both introducer and investor. There is 853 investors that are missing and 85 and like the rest is introducer but
Fred Demargne: Okay. Before you did you take from the production uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh I'm not sure I did it at 2 a.m. I don't remember exactly.
Fred Demargne: because some of the investor here should not be
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can yeah I can see for example
Fred Demargne: there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 778 does not exist. Should it be only investors that have data?
Fred Demargne: you can send me both introducer investor and then um and I will see what we can do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: But I think here you you you some of those investor some of those uh compartment if you can add the the compartment of the series every time um at least for the investor I can see that some of the investor you're showing me now should not be in the scope of the launch.
 
 
01:29:04
 
Fred Demargne: So gorilla for instance you know they have a position at zero so they
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: should
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: know
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um because green leaf as well because I deleted them but they kept the investor. So when I extracted yesterday I extracted everything all of the investors that exist. I don't know if 778 exists or it was a renaming issue.
Fred Demargne: I don't know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Okay. So, I will send the you this
Fred Demargne: What do you mean? What do you mean that you kept them as investor?
Ghiles Moussaoui: with
Fred Demargne: Does that mean that when we invite if we say we invite everybody that they would be invited to?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean if we don't have their email we will they will not be invited. But if we have their email, I mean I can just add um if we do a bulk invite with everybody with no rule then yeah but if we do a bulk invite with everybody with in specific VCs that we have data in or something like that then like only investors where we have data which is all of the data that we have imported from the dashboard then yes they will be invited.
 
 
01:30:11
 
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, we we should make sure that we don't put the email addresses to those guys so that we don't invite them in the first place, I
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think the moment we get there,
Fred Demargne: think.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I will make a list of who will be invited and we will share it with
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay. So let's try to focus uh again. J wants to launch this week no matter what and the sooner the better.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So we need to do the basic stuff right
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: now. I see that there is still a lot of work on the documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um I need to review the emails. uh there's this uh progress on the on the workflow that we need to change to in
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think what we discussed right now um everything will be done today
Fred Demargne: simplify.
Ghiles Moussaoui: from my end. What is what I cannot guarantee is the uh discrepancy in the
 
 
01:31:07
 
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: data but I think it's not too big to uh you know to spend a lot of time in it. It's only VC06 and there is just missing stuff or um a discrepancy there which I will reconcile and uh edit and I will reshare the commission files with you after um and make sure it works. But the rest in the code I think is pretty simple on my end.
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: here we today I also need to uh finalize the review of the data for vis vers
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: 2 because this we will need to load it but again I don't want to start loading it until we finish
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: vers one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. So,
Fred Demargne: So let's try to get it done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: if you can get it by today, if you can get it done by today, uh I will probably finish uh Verso Capital One today, which means I will update VC6 and I will share it with you.
Fred Demargne: Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah. You too. Good luck. Bye. Cheers. Sebastian shoes. for Alex. Joker, etc. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Premier spectator. French. Chef Spectator spectator Philippines. Spectator This public Best
