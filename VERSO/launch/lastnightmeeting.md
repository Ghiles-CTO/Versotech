Ghiles Moussaoui: Oops. Hello. Hello. How are you
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: doing?
Fred Demargne: I'm just checking what you've changed up KYC review. So, it links to the profile. So, that's okay. Then I can visualize the image. So as a CEO I can download uh the information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the CEO where
Fred Demargne: Let me show you what I'm doing. One second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: It's here. Share.
Ghiles Moussaoui: a couple of things changed.
Fred Demargne: screen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Could we could talk about
Fred Demargne: So, so here I am on a KYC review that we discussed yesterday.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: when I click on the link now,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now it goes
Fred Demargne: it links to the detail of the user which is good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: When I So I am at the CEO here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So if I want to see the document that I can see the documents here and
 
 
00:04:15
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I can download it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Click on it. It will generate some download thing.
Fred Demargne: So this I could I will check after I will prove those document where are they stored in documents uh in versal in documents here let's suppose I have accounts so investor so here it's uh pier
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, Julia,
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: you can write in the search bar. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: it's here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Julia. I
Fred Demargne: So, I got KYC.
Ghiles Moussaoui: see
Fred Demargne: So, it's fine. And here there are two because there were two. Okay. And I suppose if we want to, we can delete. I know there's no button to delete.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh it's his KYC. It's a complex thing because when if you delete the KYC then the status of their account does it become deactivated or does it still activated?
Fred Demargne: the discussion what you told me before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh it's like yeah we need
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Uh even if if we delete by mistake uh I suppose it still
 
 
00:05:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: to think
Fred Demargne: appears here in KYC reviews or not.
Ghiles Moussaoui: no yeah it's stored in one place. So if you delete the actual document, it gets deleted from the database.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the UI is just you know it's uh grabbing from one place but the document is actually stored in one
Fred Demargne: Okay. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: bucket database.
Fred Demargne: it's probably safer not to be able to delete them. Okay. So if I'm here,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I'm going to prove and then uh one I'm going to and this one I'm going to ask for more information to see if the message has now the explanation. Please provide a more recent
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: proof of address. send requests. So I must have received an email which is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Heat.
Fred Demargne: here. So that's KYC document. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: view inverso. Okay.
Fred Demargne: This button is still here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, is it fine like that view in
Fred Demargne: Uh, no.
 
 
00:06:59
 
Fred Demargne: Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: verso?
Fred Demargne: let me check the email that I sent to you. Verso tech templates emails access virtual portal. I think it's better.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Can you check the other email notification too for the one for rejection?
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, first of all, let me see in um if I get notified here. Open notifications.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, this is one issue I need to solve which is notification are not visible. Um yeah yeah
Fred Demargne: So, it's here. It works.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah I need to work on this notifications in the dropdown are not visible for some reason.
Fred Demargne: On here it doesn't appear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um so if I go back to profile
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: KYC I will I will then so okay so I'm going to upload again the proof of address
Ghiles Moussaoui: Heat.
Fred Demargne: utility bill uh proof of address upload documents Uh, so I'm back as a CEO. I refresh
Ghiles Moussaoui: utility bill v2. Yeah, the last one.
 
 
00:09:05
 
Fred Demargne: this one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So, do you want me to try to reject?
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you want
Fred Demargne: The only thing is this one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: to
Fred Demargne: You see what is weird? Uh because the first one still display as pending.
Ghiles Moussaoui: wait. Yeah, because you didn't reject it. You asked for more info.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. But then the more the new one appears as a new one here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it appears as V2 version two.
Fred Demargne: So if I reject or approve this will disappear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh if you yeah if you have to either I think reject or approve one to for red.
Fred Demargne: Let me do this one. The V2. I'm going to reject it. Okay. To try.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: This is not an acceptable proof of address. This is not reject. So email should have been received here
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: rejected.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see the other emails uh from Verso? The one in the middle view in Vers.
 
 
00:10:31
 
Fred Demargne: You see it's better. The here is much better.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I worked it. I I edited it last from what we discussed,
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: but I thought they edited the call to action as well. I have to see.
Fred Demargne: should be access portal there. So, uh,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: so here the email and the reasons appear and I'm going back here. I'm going to refresh. So, KYC rejected. It doesn't doesn't appear in the summary.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, fix
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: that works. Now, I'm going to resubmit it. So, just going back to the KYC review from the CEO here. I'm going to refresh.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You already submitted it twice, I think. Here.
Fred Demargne: You see the first one still appear,
Ghiles Moussaoui: This one.
Fred Demargne: still remains.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Because you didn't reject it or approve it. You asked for more information.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but just I mean I understand why you created a new entry,
 
 
00:11:42
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: but I think if I reject the new entry that should reject both or if I approve the new entry, then I approve the new one and I reject the old one. But then the problem is you need to block the notification and stuff. So it's not straightforward.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What about we just put the one where you reject uh or
Fred Demargne: Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: like ask for more information under another status for now it stays here but when you approve for example it goes away when you reject it goes away but when you request for more information it doesn't go away it sits here as it's it is right now right so So you did not reject it. You ask for more info previously. So this is why it sit here. Um and when you re-upload it, uh what it did is they create another version. It's a versioning thing. You mean if you want to reject one, all of it will get rejected. But I think if you just change the status of the action that has been put to which is request more information, it's more like a rejection.
 
 
00:12:57
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you think? Or we
Fred Demargne: I mean I mean ideally there should be one um it should be
Ghiles Moussaoui: could
Fred Demargne: one uh one flow you know so um you've got uh Um the first document has not been approved. It's been uh you request I requested as a CEO a new document. Um as a result of that uh you receive a new
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: document that should that should remain in the same flow.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't understand what you mean with the same flow with the
Fred Demargne: Instead of having two records here in the in the in the in the table,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I should have only one doesn't I don't need to be a I shouldn't
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: have I mean ideally I would be able to see the two document the one I initially rejected to some extent I asked for another one or or or a new one or if it's too complicated just to see the new
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's not that it's complicated. I think it's better like this because this is how I think.
 
 
00:14:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, can you go to history where you see 33 the number the tab history? So, here you will see all of the rejections and the approvals, right? And a document can have multiple versions.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So that's good. So there is just a question.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So leave it in. Uh so where do I have the first one? Wait a second. Uh P Julia I will say Pulia. Here you see in history the p the the the one where I ask for more information should should remain here but in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: It is inside the queue.
Fred Demargne: queue in the queue it should not
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand.
Fred Demargne: remain.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So that's the issue in the statuses in the actions, right? We have three actions. We have reject, approve, and ask for more info. What do you think about if we patch the ask for more info and reject into one?
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And it's one one
Fred Demargne: No, no.
 
 
00:15:09
 
Fred Demargne: I mean,
Ghiles Moussaoui: flow.
Fred Demargne: what you are just telling me I think maybe it's easier because it's the same rule whatever whenever there is an action from the CEO to approve to reject or to ask for more
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: information that record after that action goes to history doesn't stay in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: queue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. It's not.
Fred Demargne: Then when the CEO receive a second document then the second
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: document appears in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that's how it's done.
Fred Demargne: queue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's just not done for uh ask for more info, request more
Fred Demargne: Yes. So do do it for ask for more info.
Ghiles Moussaoui: info.
Fred Demargne: Exactly the same as reject and approve.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Do you think it's different for the ask for more info between like reject and ask more info? Is there like any difference between the flow? Does it change anything?
Fred Demargne: No, I don't think so.
 
 
00:15:58
 
Fred Demargne: I think I mean because of the way you you know you made a bit of a of a of a hybrid uh behavior here. If if reject um if request information is a final
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: state of this request because you receive a new document with a new entry in the queue,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: then you need to treat request for information exactly the same as approve and reject.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. Uh I understand.
Fred Demargne: If if it was not a final state, meaning that when you receive a new document and he he uh erase the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: previous document with a new one, then what you did is correct. But that's not what he's doing. So I think the easiest way and the cleanest way I believe is whether it's approve, request more info or reject, you move it to history because And that's it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yes. I understand what I'm Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So make it work the same way for the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:17:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand completely. What my question was um if you think it is better to only keep two
Fred Demargne: three.
Ghiles Moussaoui: buttons instead of three because uh the ask for more information and the reject on the top of my head are the same flow.
Fred Demargne: Oh yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So say if you click on reject still put the reason and you say the notification it's the
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: same right. Um,
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I understand.
Ghiles Moussaoui: if you ask for more info,
Fred Demargne: I understand what you mean. But um
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think the rejection makes sense on like the account level, you know, like the account activation level.
Fred Demargne: yeah, that's what I I tend to agree.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: But let's leave it like this for the
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay.
Fred Demargne: moment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All good. I will just act at the behavior
Fred Demargne: At the moment when I I approve.
Ghiles Moussaoui: correctly.
Fred Demargne: So let me approve now again.
 
 
00:17:49
 
Fred Demargne: Uh so I'm going to send again the document. Uh, upload proof of address. I'm going to put other just to see if it works. Uh, I put a proof of address here. Upload. Okay. So, I've got document. Okay. So, then I'm back as a CEO. So, I'm just going to approve it. Wait a second here. It doesn't show V2 here because all the V1 is.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I approve. Approve.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So now if I'm back as a user, I'm here. I should have it as approved. KYC approved. So I'm good. So here what I need to do is I need to add this. I don't know why it didn't keep it. It didn't uh save it be as
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: before because you had an error. If you remember, you wrote me an email about it and uh it was
 
 
00:19:00
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah, the error. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it's so I lost it's not a problem. I think here I mean it's not critical but you know the personal information you could you could uh prefill with the information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I mean there is only full name and last name that you could prefill uh in the beginning.
Fred Demargne: an email address and an email address
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: and country of birth,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: nationality, it doesn't matter. Yeah. When I roll with a mouse,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Spain.
Fred Demargne: it doesn't go down on the on the dropown menu.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh so I put the address which was before. I don't know what would happen if I don't put the same address. What would
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I think nothing nothing will happen.
Fred Demargne: happen?
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will be registered normally. It's different places. The user authentification level happens in superbase authentification records. And this is another table which is user members table.
 
 
00:20:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So investor members
Fred Demargne: So if I want to change my email here,
Ghiles Moussaoui: table.
Fred Demargne: I cannot change.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh you can I mean you can have two emails one for the account you use and one for information wise you know.
Fred Demargne: And for the notification, when we send an email, do we send the email to two addresses or to just one?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh only one only the one you use to access the platform. For now I can
Fred Demargne: Okay. Mobile phone. Put this one avenue
Ghiles Moussaoui: add
Fred Demargne: la this Paris postcode country France I am not country of tax residency it doesn't matter here one two three four If I put a special color here, does it do anything?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't remember if it it's it should only be number or
Fred Demargne: We'll see. Uh,
Ghiles Moussaoui: no.
Fred Demargne: so here what I don't understand is why do I need to again put this
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, document type, document number. I think it's for document number stuff.
 
 
00:21:36
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. I I I extracted it um from Yeah, it doesn't make sense. Should I remove it or should it be here still?
Fred Demargne: I mean the only thing it may be useful is when we have the compliance agent checking the expiry date of documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You need to have the expiry date.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, the complaints agent analyzes the documents as they are. So they visually analyze a PDF or an image of a document and extract the date and also compare it with the input of the user which is expiry date but it's also in the docu in the KYC page right so here it's like a duplicate or this is more like of an entry
Fred Demargne: No, in the in a KYC is just to
Ghiles Moussaoui: where
Fred Demargne: upload.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah a document but you can also
Fred Demargne: I think maybe document number I don't think it's critical.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think issue date uh is probably not maybe expiry date is a good one to keep because if the if the document quality that the user uploaded
 
 
00:22:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: is not good then we can uh we can use this
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: information
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean document number I thought of it as like passport and um residence permit or something like that. Not sure but the expiry date is also in the KYC upload. So we can also put the field there.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, maybe it's better to put it there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I mean um we can remove this completely as well.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, if if we ask those question about the expiry date and maybe if you put it when we upload the document, maybe it makes sense to keep those five fields.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh here
Fred Demargne: It would be better if you could the five the passport type which you we already give we
Ghiles Moussaoui: or
Fred Demargne: already it's already there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah it's already in the documents.
Fred Demargne: So, it's document number,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: issue date, expiry date, issuing country.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: By the way, if the three boxes here could be aligned,
 
 
00:23:57
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: that would be better.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, a layout issue in the KYC personal
Fred Demargne: yeah. But yeah, if you can add those four fields,
Ghiles Moussaoui: information.
Fred Demargne: one, two, three, four in in the KYC upload uh form and get rid of it here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: And then for the proof of address uh for the proof of address, we're not going to ask user to provide a new proof of address every three months to be honest. Um so I think the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hey.
Fred Demargne: expiry really is not I wouldn't ask for it. what I will ask maybe we can ask the proof of address date so proof
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: of address document date so that the compliance agent will be able to see okay if we decide after three years for instance let's see let's say that we are an algorithm where whereby every three years we ask the the user to provide a new proof of address so that may be a good idea again in a KYC upload page
 
 
00:25:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: ask for um the date but not the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: expiry and I put save
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, I understand you. Okay.
Fred Demargne: changes. So that's good. So here I'm going to put 2027 or 20 32. Save changes. Failed to update
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you go up? Um,
Fred Demargne: profile.
Ghiles Moussaoui: can you add state province thing? I think it's where some things are necessary to add. One second. I'm also checking the logs. Okay. Can you add uh a date? Um if you scroll down please to this proof of address expiry. Can you add a date here?
Fred Demargne: So then I don't add I don't add here because if I do two different if
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I okay so here I'm going to put uh for three months
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: so 19 uh 05 2026 six. I shouldn't be allowed to put five digit
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:27:40
 
Fred Demargne: Save changes. Should I?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So, take out the I mean when you take out the expiry date anywhere from the form that it will not be a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: problem.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Can you scroll down a little bit at the end? This information submitted for review. Okay. It's already out for review. So now if you go to the CEO you will see I believe that in the KS review page.
Fred Demargne: Let's go.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Wait.
Fred Demargne: This task. So in the KYC document review, I'm here. It doesn't appear. I put P.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I'm looking at it.
Fred Demargne: No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 55.
Fred Demargne: And you see if I do here uh not all the information is available for the CEO to review.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Sorry.
Fred Demargne: I am now as a CEO here. I'm looking at Pan.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: I'm going to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: edit
 
 
00:29:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: because I think there is an issue in in updating um this it didn't create a KYC review thing. So there is an issue. I will see uh maybe in the code. Maybe it's something else. done. So um am able to fix it would take five minutes. I
Fred Demargne: Thank you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: know. Okay.
Fred Demargne: I'm going to get a glass of water. I come
Ghiles Moussaoui: All good. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: back.
Ghiles Moussaoui: One minute. Okay. So it is building the deployment.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: in versel. It was a I think the issue was um it was checking if the KYC had a certain status. It was showing a fake uh submitted for review button in the investor side.
Fred Demargne: Which button? Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh it was showing a fake button the the one submitted for review. It was it should be a button where you submit for review.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But yeah, I think I fixed it now.
 
 
00:34:51
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's creating the build which will take probably um two minutes from now. Usually takes four minutes to create the build.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you think we will be able to launch on Monday?
Fred Demargne: I'm hoping yeah I'm hoping that we can I can send an email tonight to for the soft launch and then we can launch on Monday or Tuesday but that we are in a position to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: launch.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think so too. Yeah. And on the lunch we will invite all of the investors. We have the emails do I suppose
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah. except a couple of ones that we need I need to review based on the last file that you send me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: in Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Remember there's a bank C there's a couple of things like this where I need to we need to exclude them. I also need to we need to make some uh data adjustment manually because there's been some changes because of transactions happening.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, okay.
 
 
00:36:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: All good.
Fred Demargne: So this we will need to do it manually.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I don't I don't want you to do another script and so on.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Let me know when the when the build is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Did you have the chance to test the NDA process or the subscription pack process
Fred Demargne: Before I did,
Ghiles Moussaoui: before?
Fred Demargne: yes, but now I wanted to redo it before and I to do that I need to get this user to be
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: approved.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: That's all
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: connected.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So it will be Okay, it's online. Can you refresh?
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh on Pierre Julia. Uh yeah, submit personal info.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, it's appearing. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: if I want to display the information, I need to go here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you want me to add the form there to be displayed?
 
 
00:39:07
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it makes sense.
Fred Demargne: I mean yeah it shouldn't just just the two one additional button
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: which leads to the same thing. You can either click on profile snapshot like you do on proof of or you click on
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: um on here and both
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: redirect to um to here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: So I think everything is correct. So yeah, I don't see the expiry date is here of the passport, but I don't see for the proof of address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you What don't you see? Identification document.
Fred Demargne: He only shows a passport information but not the proof of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you scroll up? Maybe it's on top. Uh I mean it's okay. It doesn't maybe show. Can you click on edit?
Fred Demargne: Is it here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So it's UI thing.
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean because we will remove it.
Fred Demargne: here it disappeared.
 
 
00:40:28
 
Fred Demargne: It disappeared.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh yeah because um I fixed it. Yeah. Because there was an issue where I fixed it when we talked. You said okay um proof of address should be removed from here and only add the date in the form. So I started working on it and then we had the other issue and so there was two commits that pushed to
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: production um where yeah it was removed
Fred Demargne: So, the only thing is uh maybe you can leave it there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that
Fred Demargne: We should ask the user to to add this information at that moment what we discussed. But then you can leave it here as a as a read and edit for the passport and for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,
Fred Demargne: the the proof of address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: we should not ask the the user or should we I did not catch
Fred Demargne: No, we we're not asking at the time that we were asking at the moment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that.
Fred Demargne: We we should ask when the user go to the KYC document and here and
 
 
00:41:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand.
Fred Demargne: upload.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So hey I'm putting upload and here we should add you see you already had expiry date but I think when
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I know.
Fred Demargne: you have a proof of ID we put password and then we should have the passport number uh issue date and the issuance issuing country.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand. Yes.
Fred Demargne: So then the user provides information and then in overview you can leave it there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand.
Fred Demargne: You can leave the information to be read here but you need to add the proof of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: address not only the proof of ID and what
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Okay.
Fred Demargne: we said is for the proof of address we don't need to specify the expiry date just the date of
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, I understand.
Fred Demargne: the document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So then we can run some script and say well if we haven't had a new proof of address for the last three
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
00:42:24
 
Fred Demargne: years and we can request an update or something like that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay so now I should be able to sign in the no I need to approve the user uh KYC review here. So I should be able to approve approve So, I guess I received an email. So, maybe here, I don't think I put this in my emails. Let me see. Email templates. Your account has been approved. You see the email should be like
Ghiles Moussaoui: But this is the account approval for now.
Fred Demargne: this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's KYC. It's not the same email.
Fred Demargne: No, I approve the
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, you that was KYC.
Fred Demargne: user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now if you go back to the profile of the person uh of can you not not here but profile of of Julia the investor
Fred Demargne: here
Ghiles Moussaoui: view. No in investor view.
Fred Demargne: investor.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah not in CEO. You're in
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Okay. You mean as a investor?
 
 
00:44:05
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: CEO.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So if you go up, you see KYC status is approved,
Fred Demargne: Yeah. But what else do you need to do to be
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? Can you go to the CEO? Go to approvals.
Fred Demargne: approved?
Ghiles Moussaoui: see account activation Pulia. If you scroll down in approvals um in table in table view you are in list view. Uh if you go down the account activation Pulia the last one. Yeah this one.
Fred Demargne: this
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when you approve here,
Fred Demargne: If I put message, what happened?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh this creates a conversation with Pudia and sends a first
Fred Demargne: If I put uh welcome pier
Ghiles Moussaoui: message.
Fred Demargne: to verso tech. Um, approval.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now you can check the email.
Fred Demargne: I'm just wondering whether we really need to have that step here the personal
Ghiles Moussaoui: which KYC approved.
Fred Demargne: KYC. So approving the documents this I agree okay because we might need to ask the user to provide a new document.
 
 
00:46:45
 
Fred Demargne: So we have no other ways but the personal info it's
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: either you so once you're already approved I don't think we need to approve the personal info.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you mean?
Fred Demargne: So uh was here KYC review here I've got uh in history personal info.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: What is the point of having to approve the personal
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. Um it's how we discussed it in the beginning.
Fred Demargne: information?
Ghiles Moussaoui: You told me, okay, there's three types of, you know, things you have to approve. three types of KYC for individual the the documents two type which is ID and proof of address and also personal um
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: KYs.
Fred Demargne: But the personal the personal information is so the document that we need to make sure that the documents are
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: valid. the documents can be so I I don't have an issue with that. So I don't have a problem to validate the personal KYC information but I think once you get the personal KYC information there is already a check whether you f you filled in all the compulsory fields.
 
 
00:47:59
 
Fred Demargne: So now for me we don't need to specifically approve the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: personal KYC. What we need to do is if we have approved documents then we just approve the user
Ghiles Moussaoui: What about uh when they put a different so different information for example in the tax residency But we don't know if
Fred Demargne: and then you you put a message you send them a message and you say you you check the KYC document because we already received the KYC document
Ghiles Moussaoui: they
Fred Demargne: because we need to approve the documents first. Okay. So they will send us a KYC document. You check the proof of address. It says an address here. It says I don't know uh yeah Clarksville in uh whatever. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So in Tennessee I think Tennessee. Okay. So you've got this address and then effectively you check on the user profile and the user hasn't put this same address. So you are in here in approval you are in
 
 
00:48:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: uh so it's in history now. Where is it? Pul I don't
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's already done.
Fred Demargne: know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you go to Kenban top uh the view Kenban, you will see the approved ones.
Fred Demargne: So here. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: approved ones.
Fred Demargne: Where is it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Seven. The last one I can't activate.
Fred Demargne: Here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: But what does it say?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Assigned to. It's just when it creates it assigns to one CEO.
Fred Demargne: We have a um in production is going to assign to you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, I mean uh I am not a CEO in production just test this thing. it will be assigned to the so I we
Fred Demargne: So if there is J and I who is going to be assigned to
Ghiles Moussaoui: have to define it if you want always Julian could be always Julian if it's not always Julian some person has to be done or I thought about it some before where it's only assigned to the person that does the action so if you approve it with your own user as at freedic demand then no but it doesn't make sense because it's created from the investor side.
 
 
00:50:23
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So yeah, we can define task that could be assigned to one specific person and has for example signatures to Julian and other task to some
Fred Demargne: I mean to be to be normally the KYC information should be reviewed by Julian because I'm not the
Ghiles Moussaoui: other
Fred Demargne: compliance officer. So I should not um I can ask him. Uh but yeah, I think I think that should be we can put him uh for the KYC documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So he's the one approving. Uh and why does it say unknown here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. It's how it is created. Um and now
Fred Demargne: Should we put the name of the investor or the entity?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we should do that. I will change that. So the approval is created with unknown thing. Okay.
Fred Demargne: and you put Julian as always assigned as a CEO for KYC validation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So coming back to my point is okay you are here so you already approved the KYC
 
 
00:51:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: documents you you are now reviewing the information. So before there was a button approve reject message.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, you already did
Fred Demargne: So yeah so you you click on you click on message as I did and here you say well there is a
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: problem. Um yeah, the problem is we are we can be in the loop which never ends by the way
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So,
Fred Demargne: the message has disappear. My message it's
Ghiles Moussaoui: no because you created new conversation.
Fred Demargne: here. There's a problem. When I try to view it, it doesn't appear.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It doesn't switch. Weird. Can you switch to
Fred Demargne: I'm I'm trying to switch to other ones and it's stuck. Let me refresh to see. Refresh the page.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can on my This is weird.
Fred Demargne: There's a problem.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh on my end I can switch with the CEO.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, let me see.
Fred Demargne: Let me go to another page.
 
 
00:52:59
 
Fred Demargne: Come back. Light it works. But you see it was not different conversation. It was the same conversation. It appears as two different conversation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, because you clicked on create conversation.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. But regarding your account activation for deal, it's not me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um it was both you because you created it from the approval. So when you go to approvals and you click on message or create conversation.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when you scroll
Fred Demargne: but not the first one. Not the f not not this one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: up
Fred Demargne: Not this. Uh, regarding your account activation for deal. I didn't see this. I didn't put this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah for deal it's a message uh automatic both of them it's an
Fred Demargne: But who why does he have this message regarding your what does that mean?
Ghiles Moussaoui: automatic
Fred Demargne: Regarding your account activation for
Ghiles Moussaoui: honestly it doesn't mean anything because I think when I was creating the flow I just added the message for deal.
 
 
00:54:04
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It was probably from before. Um, and it kept the same message. So
Fred Demargne: So I think we need to get rid of this. I think you need to get rid of this because we cannot have in the same conversation and information about the account
Ghiles Moussaoui: you
Fred Demargne: activation and a deal. And here when I send a message I created a new chat. So they shouldn't be under the same chat.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes, it created a new chat with the wrong message. That's the the issue, right?
Fred Demargne: No, the the second message is good. Welcome Pier to vers attack. That's what I wrote,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: but the the other one was a was a different conversation which we need to to
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, no, no. It's not a different conversation.
Fred Demargne: delete.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's an automatic message that is sent when the conversation is created when you click on the button from the approvals page.
Fred Demargne: So why would I talk about regarding you?
 
 
00:55:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's a I mean,
Fred Demargne: Why would I say this?
Ghiles Moussaoui: you didn't uh it's just an automatic thing I created. Did I put there some placeholders when I was creating the
Fred Demargne: Okay. So maybe let's uh if you want you can automatically put
Ghiles Moussaoui: process?
Fred Demargne: welcome the name of the us of the user. So first name last name to verso tech if you want but the title should be account
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: activation only.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You shouldn't put deal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Do you prefer to when you click on that you get uh when you click on message u p Julian create conversation it prompts you to write a title in the first message you prefer that then automatic
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: version
Fred Demargne: And I prefer that it prompts you to with a proposal which you can change because here typically the meth in
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay yeah makes sense
Fred Demargne: the case I was telling you I will not have sent welcome to verso tech.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
 
 
00:56:01
 
Fred Demargne: What I would have done is I was so back to approvals um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: approvals. So here I'm here and when I send the message to Punia when I said oh I just noticed that your email address now that the the street address doesn't match with the proof of address. Can you please update if everything is fine
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: you just approve. So I think we don't need that step of approving the personal KYC that
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean I'm just uh aligning my thoughts here. What I thought about is okay say the expiry date you put there is different or say the documents or like you're just filling it as a form. Say an investor thinks okay this is a test I'm testing the platform let's just put some number here because it's a required field right let's say they put n 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 it's number the platform sees it as a number because now the compliance agent doesn't take a look it doesn't also identify if you know one street is correct or you know it's not prompted to do that um and maybe the address from the proof of address and the address they put is a
 
 
00:57:17
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: different thing maybe their name is a different thing. So this is why I thought okay it's you know it can be approved directly and then after everything is approved then it goes to the approval uh of a CEO to activate the account. So I added it okay for me all three types of KYC have to be approved. So that's why I thought um I you know it's like that right now and also um now that I'm thinking of it I think maybe it could make sense to you know go through an approval in case the investor puts um any you know information there to get rid of the form and activate their account. I don't know what you think if you want me to put it without approval. It's approved automatically when they edit it. I can do that as well.
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's not a problem.
Fred Demargne: it doesn't approve. It doesn't get approved automatically. I'm just suggesting to mix two approval. One is the personal KYC and the account approval to be one step.
 
 
00:58:23
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: That's all I'm suggesting to do. So, you first need to approve as a CEO the KYC document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: why?
Fred Demargne: And then the CEO check compare the KYC document information with the information in the profile. If this is matching, you approve once for good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah, I thought I added it as a, you know, a formal way to do it where maybe you want to check one last time or
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: something like that. It's also
Fred Demargne: we we we can still we can still check one last we can we can still check it just I just think that that approve that twosteps approval is not necessary.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, but uh the issue is before right before it was like that it was when all of the KYC's um are approved it becomes automatically approved.
Fred Demargne: which is not which is not what I'm
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the last KYC but you're saying the last the
Fred Demargne: suggesting.
Ghiles Moussaoui: last KYC which is personal info if it is
Fred Demargne: I still suggest that we have three approval instead of four.
 
 
00:59:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: approved. Yes. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Three approval is the documents then it doesn't get automatically approved.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You review the the information the personal information you compare to the KYC documents and then you approve just one last time.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand. So for now there is four, you want three. So let's say they first put their KYC information. You approve that and then tomorrow they put the the the two more KYC types which is government ID and um and the last um basically proof of address.
Fred Demargne: address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. And then
Fred Demargne: But you cannot you cannot you cannot put we cannot we cannot review the personal and KYC
Ghiles Moussaoui: so
Fred Demargne: information before we receive the documents in the process that we
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: need to receive the documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: We verify the documents are valid or can be viewed perfectly and based
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: on this we corroborate the information that the user has as he enter into his profile and the document.
 
 
01:00:41
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: But first we need to approve the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I mean that's create more complexity for so for now to do that I need
Fred Demargne: documents
Ghiles Moussaoui: to change um what you could upload first um which means or like what you could approve first because the way you say it then it means the KYC personal information.
Fred Demargne: no there's no need to to create a sequence with an order. The only thing I'm suggesting is to delete the step of approving the personal KYC. Everything else remain the same. So I will never approve as a as a CEO. I will never manually approve an account before I approve the KYC document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So when they post their KYC or the last um type of KYC to be approved
Fred Demargne: Then you go to then you go to
Ghiles Moussaoui: then yeah and it creates an approval here
Fred Demargne: approvals.
Ghiles Moussaoui: directly.
Fred Demargne: Exactly. You just skip the personal KYC approval in the KYC review.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. And um so let's say they put their KYC in the beginning the information right first before they put the documents and then they put the documents.
 
 
01:02:07
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So uh you would be in the step of um approving the documents. Say approve both documents and then suddenly uh it creates approval automatically in the approvals page to activate the account. Right. Uh regarding knowing that okay the personal info is also uploaded.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: If it's not uploaded,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: then I never get to approve it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: It's not because you technically do something. It's just I as a CEO I I get to approval. I review the information I have and I don't have any personal KYC info.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: I just have the documents. So in that case, I'm going to send a message to the user telling him, well, I request you to provide your KYC information in your profile.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. It's um okay let me think it's different um okay I can do it like that what I'm thinking right now is about modularity which means okay you have this um and also for the an entity there is their address and uh information like that and and for each member of entity.
 
 
01:03:39
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's set up like that right now where you have to approve uh each single let's say type of KYC for an entity could be a lot because if you have three members you will have to pro you know approve three KYC per member and then also I think approved the metadata KYC for an entity and then it creates the approval which can activate your account. So the modularity in a way that okay you can you can have a loop on personal information. You can ask questions regarding personal information only. You can reject it. Um you can accept it but if you do it combined with um the account approval it becomes not modular. So it becomes um no for
Fred Demargne: You mean for entities?
Ghiles Moussaoui: both
Fred Demargne: You mean the problem that we have is for entities because you can you don't want you can only approve the net but we have the same problem with the current process you know because you we let's take aside the all the documents approval because I think that works in any case.
 
 
01:04:54
 
Fred Demargne: So here we are in an entity so on top of a individual user you will have the company document. So the company documents are also documents.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So they needs to be approved separately as per the personal document here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yep.
Fred Demargne: U and then each individual needs to provide his KYC profile details and one of them needs to provide the entity or the company uh detail. So uh the CEO would first has I mean the way is going to is going to work is going to first
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: have to review the name of the directors or members of the entity and he's going to check that for each of them we've got the KYC documents he's going to approve
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: them one by one then um does he need to approve each member or each director of the entity before approving the account which is an entity account or not.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's modular which means you have
Fred Demargne: So that's so then what I was telling you to do is is fine because
 
 
01:06:00
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: H
Fred Demargne: similarly to what we say for one individual user you will need you will be you will validate the the uh account of each user in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: one step instead of two.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh,
Fred Demargne: And then and then once all the users are approved within an
Ghiles Moussaoui: two.
Fred Demargne: entity, do you need to approve the entity?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's like an individual right now.
Fred Demargne: which is fine. I mean uh maybe we can we could create a rule whereby it's automatically approved but I don't think we should do it now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: We should leave it like this because then we will see while we use it how how it works.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I understand this.
Fred Demargne: But I don't see I don't see any side effect u of doing what I
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: just told you as long as for each entity we need to approve each
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I mean,
Fred Demargne: user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you know, the um the safest and closest I think that fixes what you said is auto approve entity information and the KYC information uh of person KYC and still because it creates the approval you know as you know when you see an approval you don't approve it directly but you go check the KYC right and then you can approve so it's just automatically approved
 
 
01:07:30
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I just don't want the emails to be
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it will not.
Fred Demargne: generated.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So obviously if you didn't Oh, okay. For investor as well. Yeah, I can remove it if it's for that person.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: KYC and
Fred Demargne: Is that easier for you to do it like this? I'm I'm fine.
Ghiles Moussaoui: entity.
Fred Demargne: As long as there is no email, no notification specifically related to personal KYC, you can say, well,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: as soon as you approve the account, the personal KYC is automatically approved with no notification whatsoever. Nowhere.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: Well,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get
Fred Demargne: I just have one email, one notification,
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: one action being recorded in the UI, which is account approved.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And the documents.
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: the documents we keep it the way it is.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I'm only talking about the personal KYC.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I get it.
Fred Demargne: But yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
 
 
01:08:25
 
Fred Demargne: if it's easier for you to do it like this,
Ghiles Moussaoui: which yeah that is pretty much
Fred Demargne: I'm okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: easier and pretty straightforward.
Fred Demargne: So, um, so now that it's approved,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,
Fred Demargne: so now I should be able to, um, I should be able to see an investment opportunity and to sign an NDA. Let me see, which is what I wanted to test. So view details here. So so I cannot ask again because it was already done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What one?
Fred Demargne: So
Ghiles Moussaoui: There's an issue here.
Fred Demargne: you said that I requested that before before I was allowed to.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Should
Fred Demargne: So if I go as a CEO in approval, do I have see it's here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I remove it? I can remove it in two
Fred Demargne: No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: minutes.
Fred Demargne: Uh ah yeah because then uh yeah but that wait um I think you should not record that request until the profile until the the user is is is approved here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I should have to request
 
 
01:10:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean the the the issue was that when you created the account,
Fred Demargne: again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: we did not discuss the approval, right? So your account was active. So if you check your email, you did not received your account has been approved because the account are already active. when you created the Pia Julia a couple of weeks ago, we did not discuss the account approval yet. So, it was something that was added later on. Um, yeah. So,
Fred Demargne: Uh
Ghiles Moussaoui: what do you want me if I if you want me to again delete the uh NDA, you know,
Fred Demargne: yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: request right now.
Fred Demargne: just just did the they just delete the data room access
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, request. Okay,
Fred Demargne: request.
Ghiles Moussaoui: one second.
Fred Demargne: Excuse me. Let me know when it's done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. One second.
Fred Demargne: There we go. Breathe. Breathe.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you refresh?
 
 
01:13:28
 
Fred Demargne: Okay, let me try. Nope.
Ghiles Moussaoui: What? What is the full name of the deal? SpaceX secondary investment. Yeah, I verified by the way the active it was it became P became active the 9th of January at 11:00 a.m. So give me a second. So this takes place the database. Can you try again?
Fred Demargne: That's right. share my screen. I think there's a small problem. Share Why does it says view dear? The deal. No, it's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh,
Fred Demargne: It's okay. Request access. Request
Ghiles Moussaoui: wait one second.
Fred Demargne: access.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is an issue here. Can you close this? Uh, I don't see direct investment. Let me one second. I just have to check it. So it's just a button that is not showing.
Fred Demargne: You're good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um yeah so we can proceed with the the NDA and then there will be the um investment process what do you prefer
 
 
01:17:35
 
Fred Demargne: I should first do the NDA. But can I do it now or do you need to do a small change?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Indian draft not open allocation pending okay one second I think it's a deal issue Um I'm I'm in the C. I'm doing something. So I'm going to secondary space exary. You didn't put the deal as open. It's still a draft.
Fred Demargne: Let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. I don't see a screen by the way in
Fred Demargne: Let me do it. Don't do it automatically.
Ghiles Moussaoui: case.
Fred Demargne: Let me check.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So when you go to the deal,
Fred Demargne: I'm in G here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's a drug.
Fred Demargne: Here I'm in production here. So it's not that and to go to test up here. Oh here this is production here. Me show my screen so that you can see at the same time.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So if I'm here the deals
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: so
 
 
01:18:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So you can see the the label there.
Fred Demargne: how come it's the draft state because I put everything here and I shared it with a user. I shouldn't be able to share a deal with a user if it's in a draft state.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think when I created it with Julian he told me okay this can be done but uh but the user can only access the data rooms they cannot see the investment I mean they cannot
Fred Demargne: No, when you are when you are in draft state only the CEO can
Ghiles Moussaoui: subs
Fred Demargne: see because it means it's not ready.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: But here you see I publish a term sheet and I and I add members.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Yeah. There
Fred Demargne: I shouldn't shouldn't be able to do that if it's in a draft state.
Ghiles Moussaoui: is
Fred Demargne: But where do I change the state of the deal?
Ghiles Moussaoui: edit deal. It's just a label. So this is why it's not um so edit label button.
 
 
01:19:59
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Edit deal. Sorry. Yeah, you can see status.
Fred Demargne: So I put open. So can you please make sure when the status is draft there is we cannot uh add
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: participant.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So allocation pending I don't know what that means. I think Julian probably gave you that that input. I don't know what we need to do with this. When it is closed and cancelled,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: you cannot we cannot we cannot invite participants either.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: So I will do that open. So if you can add this rule that it's clear. So save changes. So now it's open.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you go back to the investor
Fred Demargne: So now if I go back to the investor, okay, remember here this this sentence, you need to change it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh, I think it changed.
Fred Demargne: So So I'm going to overview
Ghiles Moussaoui: Not sure if the commit came through yet.
Fred Demargne: here.
 
 
01:21:11
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So,
Fred Demargne: So can I
Ghiles Moussaoui: the change in the data rooms.
Fred Demargne: try
Ghiles Moussaoui: Did you refresh?
Fred Demargne: I'm refreshing now.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now you can see see the subscribe to investment or NDA.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, request. Can I do it? Request
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: access. So, how come I don't have uh the NDA appearing
Ghiles Moussaoui: Well, has to be approved from the CEO.
Fred Demargne: here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now there is a request that is has been sent. No. Um it has to be approved so that the NDA has will be generated.
Fred Demargne: And why do I have 300 here? I know it's you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the right one.
Fred Demargne: Uh, it's here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Is D ask you specifically to do that like this?
Ghiles Moussaoui: To to what?
Fred Demargne: Because the way that you have in the requirement is uh in the one I sent you in December after you had developed most of the features um a user request access data room and then automatically the NDA gets populated with this details and then you sign
 
 
01:22:56
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, Julian told me uh in the beginning to have to add this approvals page um
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay. So, let's give it let's save it like this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for things like that.
Fred Demargne: It's his decision. I don't want to change things that he
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: requested.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I mean we can change it later if there's an issue.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No problem.
Fred Demargne: So then what do I do now? I approve
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh did you Okay.
Fred Demargne: it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Click on notification. If you scroll down,
Fred Demargne: What do I do?
Ghiles Moussaoui: click on
Fred Demargne: I think this markdown here is not uh I think it's a bit misleading.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: I got confused myself several times where I I put markdown done
Ghiles Moussaoui: No,
Fred Demargne: but I didn't do it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: if you click page,
Fred Demargne: Huh?
Ghiles Moussaoui: can you click on markdown?
Fred Demargne: Let me try to put it in a different uh uh account.
 
 
01:24:10
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: What?
Fred Demargne: If I do
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: this,
Ghiles Moussaoui: you get the information and the open signature page.
Fred Demargne: okay, why don't I have the document here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, we discussed it previously. You told me uh I told you it's because um when I created it uh I created the investment portal first and I didn't think of the document but when you click on view document PDF you can see it in uh your editor or something like that.
Fred Demargne: Why does it say investor here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: represented by uh PS investor I
Fred Demargne: I think it's because of entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: think.
Fred Demargne: When you have an entity, then you need to put uh the role of the person.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: But in a case you don't have an entity here investor doesn't mean it's a bit awkward.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yep. Should I remove
Fred Demargne: Yeah, for individual users.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it?
Fred Demargne: Yes. And for entity I think as well.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
 
 
01:25:35
 
Fred Demargne: and here in production here it would put Julian instead of you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. The the person Julian
Fred Demargne: Okay. Here there's a problem here. Look,
Ghiles Moussaoui: is
Fred Demargne: there's a problem in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: name.
Ghiles Moussaoui: duplication because it gets the issuer and also the vehicle or something like that. Okay. I I think I fixed it before. I'm not sure.
Fred Demargne: So if I'm okay, I need to go
Ghiles Moussaoui: If it's the only issues,
Fred Demargne: back.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can fix them right now if you prefer.
Fred Demargne: Okay, let me open again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean, I can't do it automatically to the document. I can edit the HTML takes some time and uh fix it. But you will have to reapply to regenerate the
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: document.
Fred Demargne: maybe it's better I uh you fix it and I do it again. Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: If it's the only issue is I can fix it and send you a version.
 
 
01:26:54
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's better I think we to move forward.
Fred Demargne: okay, here this vers here. Why does it appear here and not in the footer? In a footer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. It's just um it's just
Fred Demargne: The document was like this. Let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: there.
Fred Demargne: And the Yeah, Verso is in the footer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Smaller. So last page.
Fred Demargne: On any pages you should have as a footer,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: verse
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, that this version. Okay, the last the page before last. Okay. Okay. All good. I will put it in the footer on each page of the
Fred Demargne: and here you see in the first page you have the footer which I think is too high and you have the page number
Ghiles Moussaoui: NDA
Fred Demargne: here above and then you don't have anything after that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. It's an issue.
Fred Demargne: If you want to put the page number, you can put it at the same level as the in the footer but on the right hand side.
 
 
01:28:01
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: It's usually better to have a page number.
Ghiles Moussaoui: The page number.
Fred Demargne: Yes. But you you can have it on the right hand side of of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. All right.
Fred Demargne: foot
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let's do it.
Fred Demargne: and I think the verso did you change also what we discussed before the to put the right
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh this Yeah, it did.
Fred Demargne: font remember we discussed it to put bold and not extra bold I think that was no or the other way
Ghiles Moussaoui: It was on the term sheet. It was very bold and I reduced it. Uh I didn't do anything on the end. It's different documents. So okay.
Fred Demargne: If you just can make sure that this is the same.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So reversal logo on top should be the same as the term sheet. I mean the term sheet you saw it.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it's fine. Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think in the email there is just one issue in the email I received for the NDA.
 
 
01:29:08
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. What is
Fred Demargne: Let me share with you. But I think it's my fault, not your fault.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it?
Fred Demargne: Uh, no, it's not this. It's here. So, the logo is fine signature in the deal section. This is This is good. Access deal versus portal. No, I think it's access virtual
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: portal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think uh I think he wrote something like
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that.
Fred Demargne: So, it's my mistake here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Access versus portal. It should be right for all all of the
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: CTAs.
Fred Demargne: What?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it for everybody?
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean all of the CTAs.
Fred Demargne: I think we should have the same button for everything. It's going to be easier. I mean,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: the same name.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: The only thing is the redirection is not the same. But the the name of the portal the name of the button should be access
 
 
01:29:57
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean
Fred Demargne: portal except uh except for the password I think
Ghiles Moussaoui: direction is Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Fred Demargne: um but yeah you see I'm looking at the it's my
Ghiles Moussaoui: That is correct.
Fred Demargne: fault I put deal I don't know one I put access deal on virtual portal yeah but I think it's probably better to put just access virtual portal so that you can use the same
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: action the same label for
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: everything
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: but that's it. Yeah. So just uh and here does it say like this in it? Let me see. Yeah, it was correct. It's correct. Um so for June you should put managing partner authorize disclosing party email below. Yeah. And when it's an entity so each user needs to sign
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it there will no um as you said before each user will get their own NDA.
Fred Demargne: Yes. So each user needs to sign this NDA.
 
 
01:31:16
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I mean each I think we said each signatur
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Not user has to be
Fred Demargne: yeah that's correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: signatories.
Fred Demargne: Um but here it would put name it will put the entity represented by and here you will put the name of the person and his
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. And for Yeah.
Fred Demargne: role.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And the roll.
Fred Demargne: But for when there's only one when there's only one user you can just put the name like this. That's it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So when it's Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You don't need to put in western.
Ghiles Moussaoui: When it's individual. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So you want to how do you want to
Ghiles Moussaoui: You have to sign from both the CEO site and the
Fred Demargne: so do you want me to continue like this and then you will change the document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think it's better. So, we can pro make some progress on the
Fred Demargne: Okay. It is sign and submit.
Ghiles Moussaoui: side.
 
 
01:32:48
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: I'm here. Sign successfully. Do I get an email? Well, I signed it. No, but it's okay. So, I'm a CEO. So, I'm supposed to receive an it's an approval or it's a vessel sign.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, there's the same thing.
Fred Demargne: So, counter sign NDA sign document. And what does it what what is here in the middle here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will render the document normally.
Fred Demargne: So, it doesn't Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there an issue?
Fred Demargne: it doesn't
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, wait.
Fred Demargne: work.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, oh, maybe can you go back? Maybe it's because of the pro what browser do you use? That is weird.
Fred Demargne: Chrome
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, for me it loads um on my browser if I go right now on the same page.
Fred Demargne: J is calling me. Give me one second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah. Yeah, no
Fred Demargne: Yeah, J.
Ghiles Moussaoui: problem.

Fred Demargne: now? It's working.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh, yeah.
Fred Demargne: Did you do something or it's just
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's a browser. No, it's a browser.
Fred Demargne: magic?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh maybe takes a little bit more time on your browser. It's using another This is not code. It's uses a browser to render the document. Maybe it's because you use a
Fred Demargne: Okay. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: coat.
Fred Demargne: G I just signed as a CEO. Submit signature.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So it's Yeah. Yeah. He sent him an email to me as a CEO.
Fred Demargne: It doesn't seems to work well because I'm clicking. Ah, you're not authorized to sign this
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. You see,
Fred Demargne: document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: so I was testing in the the dev environment.
 
 
01:35:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I put myself as the the one that signs documents. Um I can change it right now in the the PDF uh in the database if you want to sign or I can sign it on my end.
Fred Demargne: Uh yeah, say it to yourself.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the reason I did it the reason I did it is because I was disturbing
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Julian every time you know I try to test the subscription pack or NDA it sends him a notification the email.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. But save yourself.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah, it's done. Yeah, it's done.
Fred Demargne: It's done.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So here I should have a counter signature. Okay. Expired. What it is? Oh, it's something else. Yeah, because I created an introducer agreement. Yeah, I need to test this again. Uh, so I should be notified now as a as a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you see notification the two? Okay.
 
 
01:36:46
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is all Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So you need to change here account activation deal again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. It's We didn't change it. I didn't change it yet.
Fred Demargne: So you need to you need to say
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's account activation only.
Fred Demargne: uh yeah but now it's just
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, we discussed it. If
Fred Demargne: generated the message again it's a new message no I know it was before okay so it didn't appear the message
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah,
Fred Demargne: didn't appear that the document has been signed that the has been
Ghiles Moussaoui: no, it's not in the inbox.
Fred Demargne: signed
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you check your notifications or emails? Um
Fred Demargne: checking emails emails. Nothing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No notification the the icons
Fred Demargne: No. No. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: not if you open
Fred Demargne: Before.
Ghiles Moussaoui: notifications. Yeah. Din interest. Okay. So the insurance it has um
Fred Demargne: So, you need to change the name 40 minutes ago.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah
Fred Demargne: So, it's different.
 
 
01:37:49
 
Fred Demargne: was when we when I created the um when I moved the deal from draft
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah
Fred Demargne: to from draft to to open
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah no I think what happened here is when you approved as the CEO to generate the NDA it created this 14 minutes ago. So, okay, I understand. Uh I will make it like okay, your request for data access have been approved. Now, sign the NDA and uh the link should be taken to the task where you have to sign the NDA in the tasks page.
Fred Demargne: The tasks page that would be here. No, in the deal the task page view detail. I think there should be something saying that data room is now you did not change the status.
Ghiles Moussaoui: This is weird. So,
Fred Demargne: I can refresh again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you sign from both ends. Let me give me a second. I suspect it's because of the previous journey it started and now we patch it maybe disturb the flow.
Fred Demargne: But it didn't disturb the flow to get access data room.
 
 
01:39:56
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. So I'm I'm taking a look. I will understand what happened in uh the logs.
Fred Demargne: So should we reconnect
Ghiles Moussaoui: Give me a sec.
Fred Demargne: later?
Ghiles Moussaoui: If you prefer um I can take a look one minute if I find the
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: issue.
Fred Demargne: Have a look quickly to see what it is. But at some point I'm going to have to let you go because I need to I need to feed my son.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hm.
Fred Demargne: um and then uh to prepare dinner. So, but I can reconnect later.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I don't have an issue with that. But I just going to need to make a break.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: But yeah, I'm waiting now. It's okay. I think I wait
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: there.
Ghiles Moussaoui: If we reconnect later, what time should do you think that would be?
Fred Demargne: you uh probably 10:30 or 11 or
Ghiles Moussaoui: 10:30. Uh,
 
 
01:41:41
 
Fred Demargne: 11.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can, but uh, I will probably not spend an hour in the
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: meeting. What do you
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: think?
Fred Demargne: I mean I think whatever the amount of time that we spend is good because we are progressing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, what I can do
Fred Demargne: Even if it's half an hour, I don't have an issue. If you need to sleep,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: you need to sleep. I'm not going to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So, okay. Um, I will try to extract all of the points we talked about fix spec especially the NDA and and then we can try the NDA again. Maybe because this is there's an issue here. I think it's the data issue. It's not the code issue. Just because what you've done before maybe the system I think it doesn't allow multiple uh NDA accesses or if you had NDA access before I gave it yesterday to you if you remember uh to test the NDA not yesterday I don't remember when but we did something.
 
 
01:42:59
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, it's data issue. I can clean everything up and we can redo this the signature for the NDA if you prefer with a new NDA update.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: And
Fred Demargne: I mean if you have time in the meantime to do the changes that we discussed,
Ghiles Moussaoui: the
Fred Demargne: I'm okay. The only thing I need I need you to do is when you when you fix stuff just to send me a quick email that it's done with uh some bullet points, you know, of what you what you fixed because for instance today I was,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: you know, I was waiting for you to get back to me and then you told me that you fixed it last night.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So I would have had more time this morning to to test
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I thought because I said in the meeting yesterday it will be live tonight. Uh that's uh why I did not mention it in the morning.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, very
 
 
01:43:51
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: I thought it's context directly but okay.
Fred Demargne: much.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So we can catch up at 10:30. Here we'll go fix what uh what we discussed especially the NDA as priority um and the notification and all and we can catch up there we can continue.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you think?
Fred Demargne: it's okay if we spend half an hour.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: It doesn't matter how much time we spend. I just want uh if if we progress and if you fix stuff before the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand. No problem.
Fred Demargne: call, you send me just a quick email. Just no need to put lots of writing. It's just to say what you fixed so we can remind each other what we what was fixed and then that's it. We can
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: continue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean um a lot of time when I work I also find small things. Uh so you know I fix a lot of things in a day. Uh, and the process I use is like very straightforward for me where I just, you know, commit and push as a command that I registered. So, it's two clicks every time I fix something. Okay. So, I already send new
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: emails.
Fred Demargne: you you make it short. It's okay. I mean, we I don't want I don't want you to make beautiful sentences. It's just that I I need to be able to reflect what we discussed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: That's all.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Do you prefer for later on um to use something like linear linear which is uh software
Fred Demargne: like what?
Ghiles Moussaoui: engineering team thing where you have all the tasks to do and
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh
Fred Demargne: if you want if it's easier for you and I can it works fine for me. I'm okay. I'm not trying to I I just need to receive an email you notify me that I can do I
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah
Fred Demargne: can go and check on this linear and then see what it is.
