Fred Demargne: Hi. Sorry for being so late. Hello. I can hear you. I can't hear you.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hello.
Fred Demargne: Yeah, nothing
Ghiles Moussaoui: I was on another call.
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. How are you
Fred Demargne: I'm a bit uh overwhelmed with lots of stuff.
Ghiles Moussaoui: doing?
Fred Demargne: Plus, I was the issue with the flight this week. was supposed to fly on Wednesday and uh my flight was um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: cancelled because of a bit of snow in Madrid. So, I'm flying later today.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: That's why I cannot stay uh longer than three.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. No problem. Let's uh let's get
Fred Demargne: So, I will I will work more during the weekend,
Ghiles Moussaoui: some
Fred Demargne: I guess. Um so, I think the data what you sent me, I think it's almost done. Um Sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: data wise the
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: data.
Fred Demargne: the data I think is almost done for Verso Capital One SCSP.
 
 
00:24:25
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh I was struggling with the file you sent me with the update because the format of the numbers.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Uh but I find a way and I think it's all okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Nice.
Fred Demargne: I just need to reconfirm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: But I think I think we are good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I spent nice.
Fred Demargne: We are good for this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Nice. Yeah, I spent some good amount of time for the dashboard. I I tried to make it as precise as possible. Um, a lot of things were not missing. uh but the patterns in the dashboard uh for example because every time I rerun a script I need to feed it all of the rules uh which gets lost over time. So for example when I rename something and I forget to um mention it inside the script when it checks their names it does not match with the dashboard uh because it was renamed inside the DB u from previous rules. So now what I've done basically captured all of the rules.
 
 
00:25:29
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Now every time I just give it the file of the rules and it knows it and I rerun it so it matched everything correctly which is good.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I I I had Joan over the phone um after he sent us um actually he called me after he sent the voice message.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um I think we're not ready we're not ready on Monday uh for several
Ghiles Moussaoui: He mentioned something
Fred Demargne: reasons. Um one reason is um the data loading because he has not provided us with the full information about Verso Capital 2
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. I thought what I I told him I think I discussed something with him.
Fred Demargne: and
Ghiles Moussaoui: He also mentioned NDA with me. uh but um he told me we can basically launch with a small bunch of investors that could test the platform or something similar. Uh he told me the most important part is the data and the author data has to be accurate. So I worked a little bit on the portfolio page.
 
 
00:26:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um but yeah um I don't know like criteria if we are ready to launch Monday or not.
Fred Demargne: No, the data is not available.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: So I cannot I cannot check something which is not uploaded yet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yep.
Fred Demargne: Um so this is I said to him it's impossible. I also told him that for the compliance agent since he sent us something today this morning and we cannot
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: do it for Monday. In any case u because we need to test it and so on and so forth. So I I don't want to commit to something like this last minute. Um I mean the same thing as he told me you know if he he would like to send it to a small bunch of customer to get their feedback but then the first thing he said that we need to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: make sure that 100% of the data is correct for this customer.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um so that's that's something that the work I'm finalizing because there was some
 
 
00:27:34
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you think?
Fred Demargne: mistakes until now that we corrected. Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: What do you think about choosing a small batch of investors, checking all of their data? If it's small batch, you think it doesn't take much time and then we can invite them. What do you think about that? What do you
Fred Demargne: Yeah, as long as we don't say they are approved before being approved,
Ghiles Moussaoui: prefer?
Fred Demargne: as long as they cannot invest um until I think there are several issues on the statuses that uh because you were not briefed by Julian.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Uh I think there are several issues on the on the statuses including for the subscription which I worked on.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's
Fred Demargne: Um I haven't been able to come back to the email about the statuses for users because I'
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh
Fred Demargne: I've been trying to think what can we do so that it's not too complicated for the long for a launch because to be honest if you want to do the statuses as it was initially planned I think it's going to generate lots of
 
 
00:28:37
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. You can tell me and I will think about it. I mean it's better to do it right because uh for coding it does not take me a lot of time. I can move very fast but the data takes some time because there's more rules and stuff but for the coding I believe I can get it done fast depending on how many uh files it interacts with. and uh potential impact on the other code but this has to be studied as well. So I think I can get this done in maybe a day before the weekend and be tested especience agent because most of it is already present right it's just branding thing uh NDA and all of that is already present for the agent but uh yeah
Fred Demargne: So you you would like to do the agent the compliance agent with partial information we have in and have it in production for the launch.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, because I think it's easy. We can we can switch it manually to automatically, right? For example, KYC review documents, you can review it automatically or manually.
 
 
00:29:52
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, I think I can get it done this weekend. Yes. And also for the status, I'm not sure about subscription. Subscription is uh a big process, but for the you know the account by itself is not a big process. As long as authentification is not invol involved and it's just uh you know creating an approval for a CEO approval is accepted then uh you know the account is be become becomes approved active and therefore they can manage they can see data and subscribe that is I think easier to to do and for now it is
Fred Demargne: But you know it's not only about the statuses.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh
Fred Demargne: It's about preventing actions depending on which status you are
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, for now the only thing is when the KYC is not approved then they
Fred Demargne: on.
Ghiles Moussaoui: cannot subscribe but they can see data but they cannot subscribe. This is how um Julian told me before if they don't have the KYC they cannot subscribe but they cannot see the data and the data the opportunities they
 
 
00:30:57
 
Fred Demargne: Yeah, but what do you mean? What do you mean by subscribe?
Ghiles Moussaoui: can
Fred Demargne: Because I was able as a user without having provided my KYC or without having been approved to to confirm my interest. I I cannot be able I shouldn't be able to do that.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for an NDA or uh a subscription. because there is an
Fred Demargne: Interest interest is referring to a subscription.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay and did you pursue until the subscription pack is generated.
Fred Demargne: No, because I should not be able to share interest. Let me try.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh,
Fred Demargne: Let me try if I can.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it's blocked uh on some reason on some level either by the CEO I think automatically because moment you subscribe uh the CEO will receive an approval and they will see here was he not approved or it will be automatically rejected with a note. Either one of them
Fred Demargne: But on on the user interface it says that it's approved. Now whether it's really approved or not it's a different
 
 
00:32:02
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Did you accept the
Fred Demargne: question.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um, can you share your screen?
Fred Demargne: Let me open it. Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: Are you in testing?
Fred Demargne: yeah I've been testing you. So let me see. Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: All
Fred Demargne: KYC hasn't been provided. So let me share my screen.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right.
Fred Demargne: So if I am here this is my user you see KYC no no KYC information available right.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So this user is a user I use we are in testing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: so then if I look at here, I I I the CEO in test uh uh dispatched that investment opportunity that you had created and then
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it's I just clicked on I'm interested. It says interest confirmed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Next step and the side. Which one did you click? Which button? Can
Fred Demargne: I have to say it was confusing for me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you
Fred Demargne: I think we need to change the user interface for that.
 
 
00:33:40
 
Fred Demargne: Uh which button did I click.
Ghiles Moussaoui: There is
Fred Demargne: I'll have to do it for another investment opportunity to see. Um let me think. Um let me let me let me share I will do live the test. Let me share another investment opportunity. versus holding. This is production. Where is it? Because I've got several pages open depending on whether I'm a CEO
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: or a user and then depending on whether we are in production or in test. It's here. Okay. So, let me uh one second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: So I am here as a CEO. I am going to look at a deal because I was creating a new deal. I'm going to start again. I'm going to take perplexity here that you had created and I'm going to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: do
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right.
Fred Demargne: uh where was it? Tim s***. Yeah, there's a term sheets. Yes.
 
 
00:35:19
 
Fred Demargne: Interest. Uh, how do I share?
Ghiles Moussaoui: dispatch.
Fred Demargne: Um
Ghiles Moussaoui: You go to members in the the opportunity page.
Fred Demargne: yeah so add participants no
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: investor I'm going to
Ghiles Moussaoui: So the e
Fred Demargne: select yeah
Ghiles Moussaoui: to select time sheet.
Fred Demargne: uh I'm going to put where p junior here investor Select term sheet. It doesn't matter. Add uh entropy. I'm just going to check how it displayed for the previous one. interest.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep. Here I can see it as an investor. So now you should be able to see it.
Fred Demargne: So if I connect as here investment opportunity,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it's closed at the moment.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. It's just the details. Yeah. When it's closed, you can subscribe or you can change the status and
Fred Demargne: So I need to choose another one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the date data. Let me
Fred Demargne: I'll try to do it myself.
Ghiles Moussaoui: check.
 
 
00:36:52
 
Fred Demargne: So I am here edit deal and I change the close date and I will put in February
Ghiles Moussaoui: Let me
Fred Demargne: up.
Ghiles Moussaoui: 2025.
Fred Demargne: Save. Okay. I just change the date. I'm refreshing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Open. So, can you see my screen as a with perlexity? So, I say view
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: detail.
Ghiles Moussaoui: All right. Great. Okay. Which one did you click here? Okay.
Fred Demargne: So now it works blocking it. So what did I do which makes it work? Request maybe submit interest by what's this? You see I think there's a problem with a button
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah,
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is request for interest to the data rooms, right? not from investment. I only blocked it to investment directly.
Fred Demargne: So we need to change this interest is about the subscription interest is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Inter was confirmed.
 
 
00:38:07
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Next sign in.
Fred Demargne: not I'm interested to get access data room.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um if you remember we discussed this to have uh two ways either they can subscribe directly or they can go through the
Fred Demargne: Now this I agree but that's not related.
Ghiles Moussaoui: NDA. Okay.
Fred Demargne: I agree I agree with what you just said but if I say I want to get access data room I shouldn't have as a feedback interest confirmed. No access data room
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: requested and if I and if I click on
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So, it's okay. Okay.
Fred Demargne: request access data room I should right away be be redirected to sign the NDA. That's it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But the approval uh the co has to approve it first to be able to have an NDA to sign
Fred Demargne: So if I go as a CEO,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. If you go to the approvals page.
Fred Demargne: I'm going to share that screen. One second.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Now, so now I am as a CEO.
 
 
00:39:27
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So I go to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: interest
Ghiles Moussaoui: Not here. The approvals uh approvals page.
Fred Demargne: that should be here inside the investment
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: But we wrote everything through the approval the multiple approval. If you go to approvals, you will see after it is confirmed then it will be seen here. So if you scroll down uh it's deal entry.
Fred Demargne: Not this one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, the second uh one this is based
Fred Demargne: And why does what does priority stands for
Ghiles Moussaoui: on the type of um the type of task that is to be approved.
Fred Demargne: here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Right? So if it is for example an invitation um depending on what priority I put it if it is a subscription then it is more critical. If there is an NDA generation for like this then it's low but it's aliat it's not
Fred Demargne: Okay. I don't think we need this. No. Do we need this?
 
 
00:40:29
 
Fred Demargne: I don't think we need this. No.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah I don't know if it's not needed I can just remove
Fred Demargne: I don't think it's necessary to display that. Um, the only thing is that we should say, you see here the problem is it says deal interest. No, it said it should be data room access
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: request.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I get
Fred Demargne: And it should say for which investment opportunity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: So you put perplexity underneath my name or entropic underneath my name.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: Well, no. Here we're talking about the entity. So I think what it should be it should be the name of the user underneath
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: the entity
Ghiles Moussaoui: So, okay. The other way around for
Fred Demargne: and then not exactly the other way around but I guess there would be one user requesting access
Ghiles Moussaoui: now.
Fred Demargne: to the data room. It will not be all of them at the same time and each remember each of them if they want to get access to it each of them are requesting individually and each of them has to sign the NDA individually.
 
 
00:41:39
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. So it's not a user level. Now how it's done it is on the uh investor level. Um the way it is done is that all signatories will have their own NDA but one when one user requests the uh the um basically data rooms it is scoped on the account level not the user level. So when you accept this multiple NDA will be generated for all of the signatories and they have to sign each one of the NDAs to have a to be able to
Fred Demargne: Correct. That's right. That's correct. But the co needs to approve each of them, isn't
Ghiles Moussaoui: Why?
Fred Demargne: it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um why not scope it at one level?
Fred Demargne: Right. Each document is signed by one each NDA is signed by one person, isn't it?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: So here the CEO in this approval page let's say the entity
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: is business venture LLC imagine that you have three members
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: so you should you should the CEO should receive three requests for data room
 
 
00:42:49
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: access for three different uh members of the same entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, but why it will be the same? Because if you approve only one, it doesn't make sense because the NDA if one only is signed, it doesn't make sense. Like um you have to either approve all or reject all for it to make sense. Um because if you approve it right now, it's account scope. So all of the users will be, you know, you will send the NDA to directly automatically. If you reject it, it's for everyone um under the account.
Fred Demargne: Why why would I reject for everyone if one of the name is is wrongly if there is a problem with one NDA not with all of them?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: Why would I ask everybody to re to to to request access to the terum again?
Ghiles Moussaoui: nobody only one person has to request and it's account scoped directly. So, um what I think is
Fred Demargne: So everybody everybody who is signature needs to sign.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm. Yes.
 
 
00:43:57
 
Fred Demargne: The only thing is because at this point in time it's not yet a legal document that you are
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: signing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: It's an NDA.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So what we always said is each so the NDA is at the user level. So each user will receive an NDA with his name and the entity associated
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes.
Fred Demargne: to it. As soon as one user sign on behalf of the entity, that user has access to the other
Ghiles Moussaoui: The user only,
Fred Demargne: the user only and then all the user
Ghiles Moussaoui: not the other on the entity.
Fred Demargne: I user only as a member of the entity but the rest of the users if they haven't signed the NDA they don't have access to the ND to the information in the platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I get it. Yeah, for now it's it's not like that. It's it's user based, but all of the users have to sign and the U scope of the data room is open for all of the users inside that
 
 
00:45:01
 
Fred Demargne: after but after every every of them all of them have
Ghiles Moussaoui: entity.
Fred Demargne: signed okay it's not a big deal but that's not but
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. You not
Fred Demargne: anyway here I have just as a user as P Julia I have said I want
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: to get access to that room I haven't said I'm interested
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, click on it. Yeah, can you click on it? It's vocabulary. Uh, yeah. So, there is more information here.
Fred Demargne: So if I click on approve,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: is that what you want me to do?
Ghiles Moussaoui: This will generate uh in the
Fred Demargne: So I approve.
Ghiles Moussaoui: area.
Fred Demargne: I'm going to send a message to also check if it um approval. Okay. If I want to send a message. So if I want to send a message after I approve, where do I go?
Ghiles Moussaoui: you go to messages and you create a new conversation or you can do it from here via uh so if you create new chat and then you scroll down and you can add um a person an investor Julia
 
 
00:46:31
 
Fred Demargne: you. Hey, you can now request that you can now get access to the NDA to the data room after signing an NDA.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: And here what does that mean? Select one
Ghiles Moussaoui: Did you select it?
Fred Demargne: person.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's already done. You already selected P. So it doesn't
Fred Demargne: Okay. Start conversation.
Ghiles Moussaoui: matter.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So now let me switch to the to let you see what
Ghiles Moussaoui: Wait. Uh,
Fred Demargne: I do.
Ghiles Moussaoui: you can go sign the NDA first as a CEO.
Fred Demargne: First I need to first I need to request to sign the NDA.
Ghiles Moussaoui: No, the approval. Um,
Fred Demargne: Here I'm here you see back to P. I need to sign the NDA
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: perplexity. So I sign the NDA and I get this
Ghiles Moussaoui: and the signing process. Yeah, this is information you have to go and can you click on notifications the six notifications above the icon on the uh on the header of the page where near your profile.
 
 
00:48:05
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Uh wait. Yeah, you have to sign a co first. So you have to sign as a CEO first the NDA. Once that is signed then you have to I can do it on my end if you
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: want
Fred Demargne: I'm going back. So, where do I need to go? I need to go to the deal or to approval to
Ghiles Moussaoui: to vers
Fred Demargne: vers
Ghiles Moussaoui: I'm not sure if you will see it. If you don't it's
Fred Demargne: NDA counter sign NDA perlexity PR Julia. So I said sign document.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you share your screen? I do not see
Fred Demargne: Yeah, sorry.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it. Okay.
Fred Demargne: You see here it doesn't work the floor because I have not provided any information address,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Of what information?
Fred Demargne: city or country.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um,
Fred Demargne: So this NDA has no value whatsoever.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay. So, this NDA, do you remember the template you shared with me?
 
 
00:49:30
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: That's how the one it uses.
Fred Demargne: No, the template is good and I think it looks very nice.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: The template is good. The problem is if you look here parties A because as P Julia I have not provided any information then obviously that document cannot be populated properly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's not
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: provided.
Fred Demargne: That's why you should not being able to get access to data room until you provided the information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It makes sense.
Fred Demargne: You can have access to the minimum information we provide to anybody which is not under
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: NDA. But as soon as you want to get access data room,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: you need to be you need to we need to have received the information and we need to have received the KYC.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. I
Fred Demargne: And here and here if you go down what you see is there's a probably a bug with email
Ghiles Moussaoui: agree.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Wait. Later access receiving party will be requested.
 
 
00:50:32
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. or okay can you tell me um so Pier Julian is a user under one entity is the NDA also scoped for each user under the entity uh how does it change from in an account there is an individual and account there is an entity when it comes to the information like represented by somebody or how does it go because I use the exact same template with the placeholders you shared last time but it's It's on the entity level. I did not generate
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: so if you are here is not an entity just to be clear. So here the name is him. The address is a user address.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: The country and city is a city country of the user and represented by is the same person.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. This is
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: When it comes to an entity then the name here should be the entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: The register address should be the register address of the entity.
 
 
00:51:35
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: The city and the country should be the city of the and the country of the entity.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: And here represented by is the name of the user who is actually requesting the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: Galact
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. It's done like that when you have information.
Fred Demargne: and and here the email as well is the email of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: user.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. The the email of the user
Fred Demargne: That's why that's why the in the requirement You see, because of the way the NDA is uh works,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: the the only way to make it work for for us and for and to make it really useful is that the NDA is at the user
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: level. So each user each signatures each signary must sign the NDA separately. In my view, we could give access at a room for that user who signed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: But if at the moment you wait for all the user to have signed, let's leave it like this.
 
 
00:52:39
 
Fred Demargne: It's not a big deal. It's more security. I don't think it's a big issue.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: However, normally you know the idea was that before we give access data room the here in the case of an entity,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: the in the entity should have been approved.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah. I understand. then it makes sense.
Fred Demargne: So because he has been approved then we already have lots of information about the entity. So it's okay if one user only after signing the NDA gets access to the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
Fred Demargne: terum.
Ghiles Moussaoui: And uh makes sense.
Fred Demargne: So I think as part of what Julian requested to for the launch which is the NDA process that needs to be changed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: Uh the the other thing which I haven't tested is what we discussed you and me is how does a virtual sign works if you don't have an account on virtual tech platform.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It will send an email to the person.
 
 
00:53:44
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's via email.
Fred Demargne: So how do how as a CEO do I trigger this
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh the the email the email will be sent automatically for all of the cases. It's like a notification as well. Um and so
Fred Demargne: So, how do I trigger how do I trigger that this email is being
Ghiles Moussaoui: when when you sign it's
Fred Demargne: sent?
Ghiles Moussaoui: automatically sent for signature for the investor. So if you sign right
Fred Demargne: Yeah. But the problem is at the moment if I understood well if if the CEO signs is because a user
Ghiles Moussaoui: now
Fred Demargne: with an account has requested access to the terum. So imagine that you don't have a user account. So you have not requested access to the term because otherwise you would have had an account.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay so it's done auto directly no we didn't discuss this what we discussed is that okay Let's say an entity has three signatories, right? And only one signatory have a user and that signatory goes in and submit an interest for data rooms, right?
 
 
00:54:48
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: This will hit us here. But it will create a task to sign the NDA for each and every signatory
Fred Demargne: Mhm.
Ghiles Moussaoui: u but two of them don't have an account and therefore they cannot sign. So an email will be sent to them and email withoutification they will
Fred Demargne: Okay. I understood.
Ghiles Moussaoui: sign.
Fred Demargne: I understood. So you see that's why and I think it's good what you just said.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Um so it means that for me prior to uh the launch it's really important that all the we have all the data of users that we would
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: like to get involved in an investment opportunity because otherwise there might be a discrepancy.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: Is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I understand. I think I will implement the approved. I send you the email to uh confirm if uh you know the flow
Fred Demargne: he?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I said makes sense so that they can change it until the account is approved by the CEO.
 
 
00:55:49
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Otherwise I think it doesn't make sense to let them um they can see basic information but they cannot submit u you know start the transaction or like the NDA or anything like
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: that they are approved by the CEO
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay. So that needs to be changed.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: All right. Um so now what I had started to work
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: on. So how do I close this? How do I what do I
Ghiles Moussaoui: You just change page and it's gone.
Fred Demargne: do?
Ghiles Moussaoui: You just go to another page if you want.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, I'm going to go to deals. So, I was trying to create a
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay, the changes I think they're not pushed. Yeah, the arranger.
Fred Demargne: deal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's not pushed yet. It's on my local forer because I had a big task changing the documents page which took three days to have something working. Um, so it's locally.
 
 
00:56:53
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: We'll push it in the next hour if you have time, if you want to check it out. But they basically changed all of our disc what we discussed.
Fred Demargne: So let me see.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: Let me try one. Okay. With what we have at the moment. So I put X secondary
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah.
Fred Demargne: um uh investment opportunity investment secondary investment up like this. So the company is Space X Del type. Okay. So here it should not be we shouldn't put a bar this common slash or bar. There should be common and ordinary shares and then we should have just
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: um and then we yeah common ordinary preferred okay uh I don't think we
Ghiles Moussaoui: I hope you
Fred Demargne: should have other because we need to put
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: something
Ghiles Moussaoui: I was waiting. I think it told me last time we had a meeting for the many dropdowns. Um, many some stuff is missing and some stuff should not be there.
 
 
00:58:01
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: But, uh, yeah, I think we did not get to it for the vehicles as well if you remember.
Fred Demargne: No, I don't know. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: so here it's just a matter of not putting a a forward slash, just putting common end on initiates.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I think the rest is not uh it's not it's not bad. That's okay. We can leave it like this. Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Good.
Fred Demargne: I think here entity, there's obviously a misinterpretation of what the entity is. Unless I'm uh because I think here that should
Ghiles Moussaoui: 20.
Fred Demargne: be it should be the vehicle
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it's a renaming. It changed all of this in the new version.
Fred Demargne: Okay. So, if I put So, if I create a new Did I create a new one? I think I created a new
Ghiles Moussaoui: 207 is uh
Fred Demargne: one.
Ghiles Moussaoui: perplexity
Fred Demargne: I think I created Verso Capital to 600.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Andrew.
 
 
00:59:03
 
Fred Demargne: Yes,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: I think it was me.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this it's done
Fred Demargne: So, Aranger, I can add vessel management
Ghiles Moussaoui: automatically.
Fred Demargne: limited.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You don't have to do it. It's on a vehicle level. So if you dispatch to personal management and vehicle level.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Okay. So let me if I do this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So the logo I think I had the logo and here there's a small issue which is not a critical one but look it's um it's creating a white thing
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. uh to be squared.
Fred Demargne: around.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's just interpretation of the kind of the picture but I can change it if you tell me what type of formats the picture should be uh formatted to
Fred Demargne: I think we should crop uh the information.
Ghiles Moussaoui: okay
Fred Demargne: So we if it's rectangular and you need to have something which is oval that you appears as oval.
Ghiles Moussaoui: makes sense.
Fred Demargne: I think that's easier way to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
 
 
01:00:12
 
Fred Demargne: um So that's one thing. So I said next. So here has currency. We should add CTF and AD for emirates the from
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Dubai.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Currency change, right? Is Demi is currency on the vehicle level or the D level or it
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: inheritates from the vehicle level?
Fred Demargne: Should be at the deal level. Should be at the deal level. So I think it's correct.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um, so here you put a five mill. So let me put 10 and three. Okay. So I put next and here I uh so open date. So here what if I want to save as? So, I don't have time to finish or I want to make sure I don't have to restart from
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh
Fred Demargne: scratch when I um when I start again afterwards.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah,
Fred Demargne: Where can I save as a
Ghiles Moussaoui: I mean yeah for now you can create
Fred Demargne: draft?
Ghiles Moussaoui: um uh dummy data.
 
 
01:01:27
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: They can just say NA in description investment isn't save a draft as a draft but they can put it there if you want.
Fred Demargne: I think I would be good.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Yes.
Ghiles Moussaoui: So deal creation save as a draft
Fred Demargne: So let me put it like this. So I put until end of March. So here I will write later.
Ghiles Moussaoui: and a Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Create deal. Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: So
Fred Demargne: why does it say why does it say mandate here next to vaso
Ghiles Moussaoui: here
Fred Demargne: management?
Ghiles Moussaoui: um I'm not sure to be honest but I think it's
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: uh oh yeah this deal is mandated because in versa So management uh persona in I mean the manager persona when they go to my mandates you will see the deals um that are to associated to it based on the vehicle scope.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. And uh here you can see financial terms the um the per unit price per unit and minimum maximum this are are basically deleted in the new version that I
 
 
01:03:02
 
Fred Demargne: Okay, perfect.
Ghiles Moussaoui: locally yeah
Fred Demargne: Okay, so then I go to term sheet and then I want to create a new term sheet.
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is deal uh new term sheet
Fred Demargne: Create term sheet. Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: so this I need to uh so if I put for instance uh 175 here. So why do you have display text and then numeric?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Um in yeah display text should be deleted. It's um removed in the version.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: We discussed it priorly as well.
Fred Demargne: So cost per share I will put 150. Okay. So okay structure I remember I need to see what I need to write vehicle so this should be already prefilled
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's done automatically.
Fred Demargne: in
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Uh, okay. You know this is not done automatically the vehicle and the issuer
Fred Demargne: because I already I already created a deal.
Ghiles Moussaoui: because
Fred Demargne: I already associated the deal to a vehicle.
Ghiles Moussaoui: yeah the rename um should it be a drop
 
 
01:04:31
 
Fred Demargne: So
Ghiles Moussaoui: down to
Fred Demargne: yeah, that would be better.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: You sure? I mean, yeah, issuer and vehicle should be a drop. I mean, vehicle in theory should be already uh pre-filled because I already created this investment opportunity under one vehicle. So, the term sheet are under the same
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yes. Yes. At the moment,
Fred Demargne: vehicle.
Ghiles Moussaoui: the reason I didn't never edited it because I thought, okay, the renaming sometimes is is not the same um as when you
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: vehicle.
Fred Demargne: I understand. Uh, it's not obvious.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. But what I should add I believe is in vehicle you could either select from a dropown or write
Fred Demargne: So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: it yourself. From a dropown there is only one. So you select what is there and it will be the text. Uh damn.
Fred Demargne: you sure should look like this. S R L this is the issuer and then the vehicle is what I selected before.
 
 
01:05:44
 
Fred Demargne: So one SCSP series
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Can you tell me where the issue will come from?
Fred Demargne: 600.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Like in the is at what scope is it the same as a vehicle
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: or and what
Fred Demargne: When you create a vehicle, you should define who the issuer is.
Ghiles Moussaoui: is the issue? Is it like an arranger or
Fred Demargne: No thes sure it's uh is basically the entity will create the product. So in the case of this it will be vers one SCSP. It's a mistake. Uh one SCSP s***. It's not S. I think it's like this. Uh no there is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is there like a difference from vehicle to vehicle?
Fred Demargne: okay
Ghiles Moussaoui: how the issue is written.
Fred Demargne: the difference is just sure is a company so you need to add
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah
Fred Demargne: sL uh and then the vehicle is within that tissue within the vehicle you have different uh compartment or series
Ghiles Moussaoui: compartment.
Fred Demargne: yeah Um so the vehicle is one Siri or one compartment
 
 
01:06:59
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: specifically.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh but the issuer is the entity right
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay,
Fred Demargne: above.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Okay. Uh That would be it. Spread minimum tickets. So I will put 100,000. I will put 2%. I'll put 1%. I will put 20%. Okay. So here in here I suppose it's not mandatory.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think it is. I'm not sure. And maybe I'm not sure. Uh,
Fred Demargne: Okay,
Ghiles Moussaoui: can you try to
Fred Demargne: let's we'll see without interest confirmation deadline.
Ghiles Moussaoui: save?
Fred Demargne: So here I suppose it doesn't appear in the so let me I put from the 9th of February. So I will I will give until the 28th v date. So the term sheet is valid until the 13
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: February and the completion date is 18. Save. So if I uh generate PDF So what happened
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you scroll down preview?
 
 
01:08:54
 
Fred Demargne: here?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Can you click on the button above? No, no, no. This is already done. Above preview and below
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: draft.
Fred Demargne: So I date uh I think there that's a probably a bug. I think the qualified and professional I didn't fill it up. I think we should transaction time I left it empty. Structure I left it empty. So that's so that's so good. Here you have a bit of an issue. You see by
Ghiles Moussaoui: Oh yeah.
Fred Demargne: by
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh completion date. Yeah, it should be removed.
Fred Demargne: I think those those comments here should be they should be predefined but if the if the CEO wants to change we should have in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: interface you know in the form so you leave
Ghiles Moussaoui: So other input uh
Fred Demargne: it.
Ghiles Moussaoui: inputs.
Fred Demargne: So for instance you say in you have a category called in principal approval and
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: then by default the text like this is fill in and if the CEO wants to change he can change the same for this the same for subject to change it is damn s***
 
 
01:10:28
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: it's good and I put the date of the
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: 16 of March but it doesn't appear
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh did did you put it as close date or validity date or open date?
Fred Demargne: validity I put 13 completion I put
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: 18 because when I created the investment opportunity I said that it was until the 16 the close date how
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: do I come back
Ghiles Moussaoui: Near download. You should uh have a button. It's not visible. Close above.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So, I think when I created the deal,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: I said that the closing the close date was 16. I know 31st.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, I think this doesn't matter.
Fred Demargne: That's okay. That's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: It's a scope the way I thought about it before. Oh, it disappeared. Can you
Fred Demargne: Temp sheet disappeared. I'm going to
Ghiles Moussaoui: reload?
Fred Demargne: refresh. Temp sheet. No, he gets it.
 
 
01:11:45
 
Fred Demargne: I think it's a primal refresh of the page.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, it's a cash issue on the scope on the deal scope,
Fred Demargne: Yep.
Ghiles Moussaoui: right? There is multiple term sheets and and therefore you can dispatch multiple term sheets. The way I did it is that okay there is a start date and the close date per the deal. Um as you can see like when the close date is uh already gone you cannot um have any action from the investor side. You can click on um you know interest to the data room or interest to subscribe directly uh regardless of the term sheet. The term sheet is the scope under the deal. The deal defines the timeline of actions and the term sheet can be multiple close date, multiple um validity date and all of that because it can be multiple term sheets that are valid. That's how we thought about it.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. So yeah, now you have to publish it.
Fred Demargne: So you see you see here purchaser I put qualified investors and when I click
 
 
01:12:52
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: on preview there's a mapping issue because you have qualified
Ghiles Moussaoui: What is purchases
Fred Demargne: professional institutional investors only.
Ghiles Moussaoui: written qualified investors
Fred Demargne: I put only qualified investors and it says here in the temp sheet qualified professional and institutional investor only. It's a mapping
Ghiles Moussaoui: this is to but if you go to purchaser if you go below there is a field called purchaser
Fred Demargne: issue. Okay. But that's not correct because purchaser So what is the difference between two and purchaser?
Ghiles Moussaoui: I'm not sure. I think two is not is done automatically. It's just the text always is there. Uh and purchaser can be edited. Um I did it exactly as you sent the file. If you remember we discussed the templates. I took that and I turned it into HTML file. Uh all where there is dynamic data. when there is not dynamic data and then the text is automatically directly there. But as you said for the for the fields where it is like that but sometimes you would like to you know change the text that will make it possible when you create and edit the term sheet to you know display the text that is um by default and then you can change it.
 
 
01:14:12
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Is it is there a difference between two and
Fred Demargne: Yes, what I'm looking at there is a difference.
Ghiles Moussaoui: purchaser?
Fred Demargne: Yes. So, I don't know if it's so important, but yes, there is a difference.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah. Um in the
Fred Demargne: I don't know why we had actually those two things to be honest in the in the last one in the
Ghiles Moussaoui: file
Fred Demargne: last version that you have from Julian.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: Uh what did he say of the term
Ghiles Moussaoui: There's version of
Fred Demargne: sheet?
Ghiles Moussaoui: what?
Fred Demargne: So if I look at vers I think because I think Julian sent you some stuff, no sent you some term sheet in the first place.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I don't know if I have it here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I don't know. I think I send it to you.
Fred Demargne: Yeah,
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can send them right now.
Fred Demargne: because me I I updated the field of uh the term sheet I sent you is different from that.
 
 
01:15:12
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yep.
Fred Demargne: If I had sent you is different and the tool and the purchaser is
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah,
Fred Demargne: different.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I can share my screen of the one you sent to me. Term sheet. Date two. Yeah, the purchaser is different from the uh the description.
Fred Demargne: the two.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, the two is two description and it's written qualified professional and institutional investors only. Uh purchaser is vehicle.purchaser qualified limited partners and in
Fred Demargne: Exactly.
Ghiles Moussaoui: institutional clients between parenthesis purchaser.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. So that's why for me it should be different.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: It should be all It should be all um up to the to the CEO to to
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: mention
Ghiles Moussaoui: Wait, sorry. Do you mean there is some fields that you don't want to mention?
Fred Demargne: no I mean even where it's a fixed uh free text which is pretty fine
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: where you don't see that there is much difference I
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
 
 
01:16:24
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. I get it. The co can change it whenever.
Fred Demargne: Yes, it's just that uh you know it's free text. So that's okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: So you need to correct this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think you need to check this close button here.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. It's for all preview document. I will change
Fred Demargne: It's a small problem but okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: it.
Fred Demargne: All right. So that's where I am at the moment. Um so still quite some stuff to do. Um so the flow of interest. So if I come back here as a user I'm going to share my screen. Um, how do I share my screen here? So, yeah, I'm back to the user, the investor at the beginning.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Hey, can I see your screen? Okay. Do
Fred Demargne: So view is correct interest at the moment I have not expressed any interest. So here interest should should remain
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
 
 
01:17:48
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Yeah,
Fred Demargne: uncheck.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I understand. Um, yes, the progress bar interest is written for um NDA.
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I think I should create two routes where the route which is NDA and then uh subscription pack or directly subscription pack. Uh, and tell me if I got this wrong, but when you submit an investment directly without um having access to the data rooms, uh, do you need to also sign an NDA with the subscription pack or how does it go?
Fred Demargne: Say it again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: When you submit an interest to uh invest directly without the data rooms,
Fred Demargne: Yeah.
Ghiles Moussaoui: does it mean that you have to sign both the subscription pack and the NDA or just the subscription
Fred Demargne: No,
Ghiles Moussaoui: pack?
Fred Demargne: just a subscription pack.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Okay, I'm gonna have to go because I'm going to miss my flight to take my flight at
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, no problem.
Fred Demargne: 5:00. So, I'm already in a bit of a rush and make myself available this
 
 
01:19:07
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Do I have Yeah. Okay.
Fred Demargne: weekend.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh, do you think I should forward with the approval implementation of the email I sent to you or I should wait for your input?
Fred Demargne: Say it again.
Ghiles Moussaoui: for the approval of the account, right? Should I change it to uh
Fred Demargne: No, no, I'll send you I prepare the email in the flight.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: I'll spend some time on this as a priority.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: Um for me the first status of a user should be new.
Ghiles Moussaoui: You Okay.
Fred Demargne: You've been invited. So you are new.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: If you want you can implement this but I don't think it makes sense to do just this.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: And then um I'm thinking about the intermediate status. So I I mean I had a document with all the intermediate status because I had we had developed this when I when we developed the app. I'm just uh I was just worried that if I give you all the statuses that you're going to have lots of work to do,
 
 
01:19:58
 
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: but you said you just said no, that not necessary.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh so maybe I will send you all of them then you
Ghiles Moussaoui: Take a look at it. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: can you can let me know.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah, that works.
Fred Demargne: So me I'm going to do this uh I need to finalize the work on data migration for Verso Capital 1 SCSP.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: I have requested Julian to provide the same thing for Verso Capital 2 SCSP.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: Uh so that's why
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh you send me two batches of VC firms uh contacts and also Monaco firms I think of emails and contact information. Is it for accounts that already exists in the DB or it's new stuff?
Fred Demargne: You're talking about the batch of emails.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: I think they were initially from the same spreadsheet you had sent me where we had 83 emails missing.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Mhm.
Fred Demargne: So that's the complimentary information for those 83 emails. So now we are missing around 15.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Are you sure it's those two?
Fred Demargne: Yeah, I am sure.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. All right.
Fred Demargne: Yep. Does that make
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: sense?
Ghiles Moussaoui: Uh I will match them and I will let you know. Normally if it's the same then all of them will match with no problem.
Fred Demargne: Okay.
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: All right. So,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay.
Fred Demargne: we'll stay in touch and we'll try to speak this weekend. Um,
Ghiles Moussaoui: Yeah.
Fred Demargne: might have a bit of an issue in the morning on tomorrow, but afterwards I think I can be a bit more
Ghiles Moussaoui: Okay. Me too. Yeah.
Fred Demargne: flexible.
Ghiles Moussaoui: I'm flexible whenever. Um all right.
Fred Demargne: Yeah. Thank you.
