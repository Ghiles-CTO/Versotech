Total rules: 85

| Rule ID | Scope | Exact Rule Wording | Status | Source | Engine Location | Exact Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R01 | VC1 | Introducer name aliases (VC1 scope) — Anand/Set Cap, Dan/Daniel, Rick/Altras, Terra/TERRA, Setcap+Daniel replacement, Anand+Dan -> Set Cap | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 126-136, 354-399; rules_vc1.json lines 88-142 (54 alias entries) | All documented VC1 aliases are present in the 54-entry alias dict. Combined-name cells handled via combined_introducer_name_policy=fail. |
| R02 | VC2 | Introducer name aliases (VC2 scope) — Renbridge/Renaissance, Headwall/AGP, Aeon, Old City, Astral/Astra, Lafferty, Bromley, VOGT, CHEN, Bright Views | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 123-133, 305-314; rules_vc2.json lines 48-84 (24 alias entries) | All documented VC2 aliases are present. Includes Lafferty+Visual Sectors -> Visual Sectors, Dimensional Advisors + Lafferty -> Dimensional Advisors. |
| R03 | VC1/VC2/IN | Investor name normalization — strip titles, & -> and, limited -> ltd, remove punctuation, token replacements (dan->daniel, mickael->michael), two-name swap, explicit investor aliases | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 83-109 (normalize_text, canonical_name_key, compact_name_key, loose_name_key); same in vc2 lines 59-95 and in lines 66-102 | Title stripping, & replacement, punctuation removal, alphabetical token sorting (handles A and B = B and A), investor aliases all present. Note: limited->ltd NOT implemented (not in normalize_text); crude depluralization strips trailing 's' from words > 4 chars instead. |
| R04 | VC2 | VC2 canonical naming rule — use client file legal names for storage, dashboard names for matching only | PARTIAL | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json alias system | Engine validates name matching via aliases but does NOT verify that stored DB names are legal names vs. dashboard shorthand. Alias mapping is correctly matching-only. |
| R05 | VC1 | Investor dedup rules — Talal PASHA->CHAMSI PASHA, Sandra CABIAN->KOHLER CABIAN, Sheikh AL SABAH->Yousef AL SABAH, Zandera Finco->Holdco | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1571-1579 (investor_identity_duplicate_check); rules_vc1.json investor_aliases_by_vehicle lines 261-268 | Engine detects duplicate investor IDs via canonical_name_key. Vehicle-scoped aliases handle Zandera mapping. Dedup pairs are resolved through the alias system. |
| R06 | VC1 | Introducer cleanup / merge — Stableton+Terra replaced, Denis Matthey deleted, GEMERA old ID merged | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1571-1579 (identity dup check); alias system | Engine detects duplicate introducer IDs but does NOT specifically verify that stale IDs (e.g. old GEMERA 61e01a81) have zero FK references. Relies on commission FK check indirectly. |
| R07 | VC1/VC2/IN | Commission basis types and rate conversion — dashboard percent = decimal fraction, rate_bps = percent * 10000 | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1894-1941 (specific_rule_assertions — DISABLED for VC1); run_vc2_audit.py lines 1341-1357, 1496-1517 | VC2/IN: rate_bps compared for performance_fee tiers. VC1: rate_bps validation is in specific_rule_assertions which is DISABLED. No standalone check that rate_bps = round(percent * 10000) across all commission rows. |
| R08 | VC1/VC2/IN | Invested amount commission calculation — use dashboard Subscription fees when available, otherwise amount_invested * percent | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 549-841 (commission extraction); lines 1669-1794 (row-level commission parity) | Engine extracts invested_amount commissions from dashboard and compares accrual_amount against DB. Amount parity checked per (vehicle, investor, introducer, basis_type). |
| R09 | VC1/VC2/IN | Spread commission calculation — use dashboard Spread PPS Fees, otherwise Spread PPS * shares | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | Same as R08 — spread basis type extracted and compared in row-level commission parity | Spread commission amounts validated. However, spread rate_bps comparison is explicitly skipped in IN scope (line 1552: if basis != spread). |
| R10 | VC1/VC2/IN | Performance fee commission rows — accrual_amount = 0.0, threshold_multiplier = 0.0, one row per tier per investor per introducer | PARTIAL | historical_rules | VC1: performance_fee NOT in commission_match_basis_types (HIGH gap I1). VC2/IN: performance_fee_tier1 and tier2 checked as rate-only (amount always 0.0) | VC1: Performance fee commissions are completely excluded from row-level validation (only covered by duplicate check and FK check). VC2/IN: Rate-only validation — amounts not checked since they are 0.0 by design. |
| R11 | VC1/VC2/IN | All commissions status = paid — applied 2026-01-31 across all 867 rows | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py (commission_status_invalid check), run_vc2_audit.py (commission_status_invalid check), run_in_audit.py (commission_status_invalid check); rules_*: checks.commission_status_must_be_paid + allowed_commission_statuses | Implemented across all scopes as hard failure when DB commission status is not in allowed set (default: paid). |
| R12 | VC1/VC2/IN | Commission duplicate detection — exact duplicates (all fields identical except id/created_at), keep earlier row, delete stale batch rows with rate_bps=0 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1597-1618; run_vc2_audit.py lines 1216-1236; run_in_audit.py lines 1259-1281 | 9-field composite key duplicate detection implemented in all scopes. Stale batch rows with rate_bps=0 handled via zero-amount exclusion from row-count parity (abs(amount) <= 0.01 excluded). |
| R13 | VC1/VC2/IN | Commission split rules — investors with 2+ subscriptions need matching split commission rows with different base_amount | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1780-1794 (row count mismatch + split mismatch checks) | Row count per (vehicle, investor, introducer, basis_type) is compared. Split amounts are compared when counts match. However base_amount is NOT independently validated (gap I8 in VC1 audit). |
| R14 | VC1/VC2/IN | Commission total ruled diffs — expected deltas per vehicle (IN102, IN103, IN106, VC113, VC114, VC106) | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1620-1667; rules_vc1.json lines 209-214. run_in_audit.py lines 1283-1330; rules_in.json lines 309-316 | All documented vehicle deltas are configured as ruled diffs. VC1: spread diffs for VC106 (+0.058), VC113 (+0.0125), VC114 (-0.4). IN: invested_amount diffs for IN102, IN103, IN106; spread diff for IN103. |
| R15 | VC1 | Zero-amount commission artifacts — 66 rows in VC106 with rate_bps=0, accrual_amount=0; excluded from row-count parity; flagged but not failures | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1714-1716 | DB commission rows with abs(amount) <= 0.01 are excluded from row-count parity checks but still contribute to aggregate totals. Correctly prevents false failures. |
| R16 | VC1/VC2/IN | Partners are treated as introducers — dashboard Partner columns extracted alongside Introducer columns, both flow into introducers/introductions/commissions tables | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | All three scope engines extract both introducer and partner commission slots from dashboard | Commission extraction handles multiple slots per sheet (partner + introducer columns). All commissions link to introducers table. |
| R17 | VC2 | R. F. Lafferty = BROKER only (VC2) — removed from introducers table, 0 commission rows, 0 introduction rows | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 1558-1571 (forbidden_in_introducers_master, forbidden_in_introductions_global); lines 1604-1614 (forbidden_commission_pairs for VC203/VC207/VC209) | Lafferty is in forbidden_in_introducers_master (must not appear in introducers table) AND forbidden_in_introductions_global (must not appear in introductions). Specific vehicle pairs also forbidden. |
| R18 | VC2 | Old City Securities LLC = DUAL ROLE (VC2) — exists in both brokers and introducers tables | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 1545-1552 (broker table expected names); rules_vc2.json expected_brokers | Engine checks expected brokers exist in brokers table (Old City should be listed). However, no explicit check that Old City also exists in the introducers table — the dual-role assertion is only half-checked. |
| R19 | VC2 | Bromley Capital Partners = context-dependent role — BROKER in VC215 (commissions removed, paired rates reduced by 100bps), INTRODUCER in VC202/VC206/VC209 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 1604-1614 (forbidden_commission_pairs: VC215+Bromley); specific_commission_expectations entries 5-7 (Bromley retained in VC202/VC206/VC209); rules_vc2.json broker_like_introducers_forbidden_by_vehicle | Bromley forbidden on VC215 via forbidden_commission_pairs. Bromley commissions asserted on VC202 (80000@80bps), VC206 (30000@150bps), VC209 (18849.42@196bps) via specific_commission_expectations. |
| R20 | VC2 | VC215 Set Cap = spread-only partner — invested_amount 14 rows all $0.00, spread 14 rows sum $25654.81 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 1665-1682 (set_cap_vc215_spread_only_check); rules_vc2.json lines 193-197 | Dedicated check verifies Set Cap invested_amount commissions on VC215 sum to zero. |
| R21 | VC2 | Bright Views Holdings = internal placeholder, not real introducer — 3 commission rows ($9000) for Jamel CHANDOUL in VC209, warning only | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json lines 198-200 (warnings_only_introducers); run_vc2_audit.py lines 1470-1476 | Bright Views is in warnings_only_introducers. Extra-in-DB commissions for Bright Views produce warnings instead of failures. |
| R22 | VC2 | Documented split assertions (VC2) — VC203 EVERLASTING, VC206 REDPOINT OMEGA V, VC209 PVPL, Bromley retained on VC202/VC206/VC209 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json lines 109-173 (specific_commission_expectations, 8 entries); run_vc2_audit.py lines 1616-1682 | All 8 documented split assertions are configured and checked: Sakal 5000@50bps, Astral 10000@100bps, Visual Sectors 82000@111bps, Astral 90000@122bps, Visual Sectors 10000@10bps, Bromley VC202/VC206/VC209. |
| R23 | VC1/VC2/IN | Dashboard is source of truth — every non-zero dashboard row becomes a subscription, 1:1 mapping, repeated rows = separate subscriptions | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1215-1419 (row-level subscription matching); run_vc2_audit.py lines 1065-1161; run_in_audit.py lines 1089-1188 | Multi-pass matching ensures 1:1 pairing. Unmatched rows on either side are hard failures. Repeated dashboard rows treated as separate subscriptions. |
| R24 | VC1/VC2/IN | Zero ownership rule — if dashboard ownership/units = 0, do NOT create subscription or position; commissions can still exist | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1511-1542 (zero_ownership_must_not_be_loaded); same in vc2 lines 1163-1185 and in lines 1206-1228 | Zero-ownership dashboard rows are excluded from active list. Engine checks that they are NOT present as DB subscriptions. Commission totals still include zero-ownership rows. |
| R25 | VC1/IN | Missing ownership handling — blank row = not active, missing column entirely (IN101/IN102/IN109/IN111) = treat all as active | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc1.json dashboard_blank_ownership_as_active_by_sheet lines 233-235 (VC22); run_in_audit.py dashboard_ownership_fallback_to_shares_if_missing (rules_in.json line 45) | VC1: VC22 blank ownership treated as active. IN: fallback to shares when ownership column missing. Per-sheet ownership column presence handling is implemented. |
| R26 | VC2 | Subscription status/funding rules (VC2) — status = funded, funded_amount = commitment | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 1187-1199 (status_must_be_funded + funded_amount_equals_commitment) | Both checks enabled and confirmed in code. Tolerance of 0.01 for funded_amount comparison. |
| R27 | VC1/VC2/IN | Every subscription must have deal_id — NULL deal_id is erroneous when vehicle has one deal | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1559-1561; run_vc2_audit.py lines 1048-1050; run_in_audit.py lines 1072-1074 | subscription_deal_id_required check enabled in all three scopes. |
| R28 | VC1/VC2/IN | bd_fee_amount calculation rule — bd_fee_amount = commitment * bd_fee_percent; flag rows where bd_fee_amount equals bd_fee_percent exactly | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1421-1467 (row-level numeric field comparison includes bd_fee) | Engine compares dashboard bd_fee against DB bd_fee_amount per matched row. However, no specific check that bd_fee_amount = commitment * bd_fee_percent as a cross-field validation. No flag for bd_fee_amount == bd_fee_percent bug pattern. |
| R29 | VC1/VC2/IN | subscription_fee_amount calculation rule — subscription_fee_amount = commitment * subscription_fee_percent | PARTIAL | historical_rules | Same as R28 — row-level comparison of sub_fee field | Dashboard sub_fee compared to DB subscription_fee_amount. No cross-field validation that sub_fee_amount = commitment * sub_fee_percent. Relies on dashboard being correct. |
| R30 | VC1 | VC106 performance_fee_tier1_percent convention — whole numbers (20=20%), all others use fractions (0.2=20%) | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 156-198 (fraction_or_percent_strict normalization); rules_vc1.json lines 239-260 (percent_compare_rules) | All five percent fields use fraction_or_percent_strict mode: 0.2 and 20 are treated as equivalent. allow_divide_if_abs_gte: 100 handles the VC106 whole-number convention correctly. |
| R31 | VC1 | Cost per share priority rule — use Cost per Share when present, else Final Cost per Share, else NULL | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | Dashboard parsing reads 'Cost per Share' column; rules_vc1.json row_blank_value_skip_metrics includes cost_per_share | If dashboard cell is blank, cost_per_share comparison is skipped (row_blank_value_skip_metrics). Column detection handles Cost per Share column. |
| R32 | VC1/VC2/IN | Spread fee calculation — spread_fee_amount = spread_per_share * num_shares | PARTIAL | historical_rules | Row-level comparison includes spread_fee (dashboard vs DB). No cross-field validation. | Engine compares dashboard spread_fee against DB spread_fee_amount. Does NOT independently verify spread_fee_amount = spread_per_share * num_shares as a cross-field check. |
| R33 | VC1/VC2/IN | Vehicle sheet to code mapping — VCxx -> VC1xx, INxx -> IN1xx (prepend 1) | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc1.json lines 35-63 (dashboard_vehicle_alias, 27 entries); rules_vc2.json lines 30-33; rules_in.json lines 29-41 | All alias maps correctly map dashboard sheet codes to DB vehicle codes. VC1: +100 offset. IN: +100 offset. VC2: VCS001/VCS002 -> VC203. |
| R34 | VC1 | VC122 column parsing correction — OWNERSHIP POSITION = column 17, Number of shares = column 16 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | Dashboard parsing uses header-based column detection (not hardcoded indices); rules_vc1.json dashboard_blank_ownership_as_active_by_sheet for VC22 | Column detection is header-based, so correct columns are resolved by name rather than index. VC22 has special blank-ownership handling. |
| R35 | IN | IN110 ETH-denominated amounts — parse ETH prefix to extract numeric values | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_in_audit.py lines 28-46 (to_float function uses regex extraction) | to_float() extracts first numeric value from strings like 'ETH xx.xx'. Works for IN110 ETH amounts. Note: silently converts other error strings to 0.0. |
| R36 | VC2 | VC203 commission slot override — column positions shifted by 1 from default | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json lines 218-231, 239-243, 258-271 (dashboard_commission_slots by_sheet for VC203) | VC203 explicit slot config: name [44,54], invested [46,56], spread [52,62] vs default [43,53], [45,55], [51,61]. Matches documented override exactly. |
| R37 | VC2 | VCL001 and VCL002 separation from VC203 — 4 AGP subscriptions moved, not part of VC2xx scope | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json commission_totals_exclude_vehicle_codes lines 279-282 (VCL001/VCL002 excluded from commission checks); scope_vehicle_codes includes VCL001/VCL002 | VCL vehicles are in scope but excluded from commission total and row-level commission checks. No dashboard sheets exist for them, preventing double-counting. |
| R38 | VC1 | VC1 max_introducers_per_subscription = 3 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1805-1819; rules_vc1.json line 82 (max_introducers_per_subscription: 3) | Threshold set to 3. Flags investor+deal combinations exceeding this count. |
| R39 | VC1 | VC1 skip cost_per_share and ownership in vehicle totals | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc1.json vehicle_totals_skip_metrics (line 1193 of run_vc1_audit.py): cost_per_share, ownership, sub_fee_percent, management_fee_percent, perf1_percent, perf2_percent, bd_fee_percent | Both cost_per_share and ownership are in the skip list. Actually skips 7 metrics total at vehicle level. |
| R40 | VC1 | VC126 ruled fallback: OEP Ltd -> Julien MACHOT | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc1.json fallback_ruled_name_pairs lines 269-291 (7 entries for OEP Ltd -> Julien MACHOT across VC106/VC112/VC113/VC122/VC124/VC125/VC126) | OEP Ltd -> Julien MACHOT fallback pair is configured for 7 vehicles including VC126. |
| R41 | VC1 | VC113 alias: Zandera (Finco) Limited -> Zandera (Holdco) Limited | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc1.json investor_aliases_by_vehicle lines 261-268 (VC113: Zandera Finco -> Zandera Holdco) | Vehicle-scoped investor alias correctly configured. Also has VC111: Zandera Finco -> Michael RYAN. |
| R42 | VC1/VC2/IN | Position uniqueness per investor+vehicle — only one position row per (investor_id, vehicle_id) | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1585-1589; run_vc2_audit.py lines 1205-1209; run_in_audit.py lines 1248-1252 | Duplicate position detection checks for count > 1 per (investor_id, vehicle_id) in all scopes. |
| R43 | VC1/VC2/IN | No zero-unit positions | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1582-1584; run_vc2_audit.py lines 1202-1204; run_in_audit.py lines 1245-1247 | Position rows with units near zero are flagged as failures in all scopes. |
| R44 | VC1/VC2/IN | Position units = aggregate dashboard ownership per investor — positions.units must match dashboard ownership sum | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1475-1509 (per-investor ownership parity + vehicle-level); run_vc2_audit.py lines 1201-1214; run_in_audit.py lines 1190-1257 | Per-investor and per-vehicle position/ownership parity checks implemented in all scopes. |
| R45 | VC1/VC2/IN | Currency from dashboard, no assumptions — currency set from dashboard row, some VC125 rows use EUR | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py / run_vc2_audit.py / run_in_audit.py: DashRow.currency + DbSub.currency + subscription_currency_mismatch check; deals query includes currency; rules_*: dashboard_currency_header_candidates + checks.currency_must_match_dashboard_when_present | Implemented when dashboard currency column is present; compares dashboard row currency to DB deal currency per matched subscription row. |
| R46 | VC1/VC2/IN | rate_bps is integer — dashboard shows fractional rates, DB stores integer | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 1496-1517 (rate_bps parity); run_in_audit.py lines 1552-1573 | VC2/IN: rate_bps compared as sets for matched commission tuples. VC1: rate_bps only checked in disabled specific_rule_assertions. No explicit check that rate_bps is always integer. |
| R47 | VC1/VC2/IN | Dashboard combined-introducer cells — cells with + or multi-line names treated as warnings | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 789-813 (policy=fail); run_vc2_audit.py lines 625+ (policy=ignore); run_in_audit.py lines 619-664 (policy=ignore) | VC1: combined names cause failure. VC2/IN: combined names silently ignored (policy=ignore), tracked at aggregate level only. Documented as a gap for VC2/IN. |
| R48 | VC1/VC2/IN | Subscription matching order — numeric gate, tie-breakers, name keys for disambiguation | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1215-1419 (5-pass matching); run_vc2_audit.py lines 1065-1161 (2-pass); run_in_audit.py lines 1089-1188 (2-pass) | VC1 uses 5 fallback passes (exact, loose name+amounts, amounts+date, investor+shares+date, amounts only). VC2/IN use 2-pass (exact date then relaxed positional). Priority order matches documented rule. |
| R49 | VC2 | Red rows in client file = excluded | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py lines 1700-1709 (contacts file red row detection by fgColor.rgb ending FF0000) | Red rows excluded from contacts validation. Note: detection depends on exact color code #FF0000; different red shades could bypass filter. |
| R50 | VC1 | Strikethrough rows in commission file = deleted from DB | MISSING | historical_rules | Not implemented in any scope engine | Engine does not read or parse Excel formatting (strikethrough). Cannot verify that strikethrough-marked rows have been removed from DB. This is a pre-import rule. |
| R51 | VC1/VC2/IN | Client override commissions take precedence over dashboard | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json specific_commission_expectations lines 109-173 (8 entries); rules_in.json lines 96-124 (4 entries); run_vc2_audit.py lines 1402-1424 (override logic) | Specific commission expectations serve as client overrides. When DB matches expected value but dashboard differs, mismatch is downgraded to warning (commission_row_ruled_dashboard_override). |
| R52 | VC1/VC2/IN | One introduction per unique (introducer_id, investor_id, deal_id) — introduced_at = contract_date, status = allocated | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1796-1803 (commission FK check verifies introduction exists); no uniqueness check on introductions themselves | Engine verifies commissions point to valid introductions (FK check). Does NOT verify introduction uniqueness per (introducer_id, investor_id, deal_id). Does NOT verify introduced_at = contract_date or status = allocated. |
| R53 | VC1/VC2/IN | Every commission must point to an existing introduction — no orphaned commission rows | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1796-1803; run_vc2_audit.py lines 1519-1526; run_in_audit.py lines 1575-1582 | Commission FK check verifies introduction_id references exist. Broken FKs are failures in all scopes. |
| R54 | VC2 | VC206 REDPOINT OMEGA V unequal split — Visual Sectors 111bps $82000, Astral Global 122bps $90000, total $172000 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json specific_commission_expectations entries 2-3 | Visual Sectors 82000@111bps and Astral Global 90000@122bps are explicit assertions. |
| R55 | VC2 | VC209 PVPL split after Lafferty removal — Visual Sectors corrected to 10bps $10000 | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json specific_commission_expectations entry 4 | Visual Sectors 10000@10bps on PVPL is an explicit assertion. |
| R56 | VC2 | VC215 Bromley paired-introducer rate adjustment — remaining introducer keeps original rate minus 100bps | PARTIAL | historical_rules | rules_vc2.json forbidden_commission_pairs (VC215+Bromley); ruled diffs for VC215 | Bromley commissions forbidden on VC215. However, no explicit assertion that remaining paired introducers had their rates reduced by exactly 100bps. Commission total ruled diff covers aggregate but not per-row rate adjustment. |
| R57 | VC2 | Multi-introducer spread zero issue (VC2) — 21 rows with spread_fee > 0 but introducer spread commissions = 0 | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc2_audit.py row-level commission parity (commission_row_missing_in_db for spread) | Missing spread commissions would be caught by commission_row_missing_in_db checks. However, combined introducer policy=ignore means some of these rows may be silently skipped. No dedicated check for the multi-intro spread zero pattern. |
| R58 | N/A | No SELECT * in queries | N/A | historical_rules | N/A | Code convention, not a data verification rule. Not applicable to the engine. |
| R59 | VC1/VC2/IN | Commission basis is always funded_amount — fee tiers only affect investor fees, not partner commissions | PARTIAL | historical_rules | No explicit base_amount vs funded_amount cross-check | Engine does not validate that commission base_amount aligns with funded_amount. base_amount is only used in the exact-duplicate check key (gap I8 in VC1 audit). |
| R60 | VC1/VC2/IN | Reuse existing investor/introducer records — no duplicate creation, resolve aliases first | IMPLEMENTED | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py lines 1571-1579; run_vc2_audit.py lines 1060-1063; run_in_audit.py lines 960-985, 1084-1087 | investor_identity_duplicate_check detects same canonical name mapping to multiple investor_id UUIDs across all tables (subscriptions, positions, introductions, commissions). |
| R61 | VC1 | VC111 BAUMSLAG/FINALMA fee swap correction — specific field values after correction | PARTIAL | historical_rules | run_vc1_audit.py row-level numeric comparison; specific_rule_assertions DISABLED for VC1 | Row-level comparison would catch mismatches if dashboard has correct values. However, no dedicated assertion for these specific subscription values. specific_rule_assertions is disabled. |
| R62 | VC1 | VC113 MACHOT/OEP perf1 swap correction — direct (perf1=0) and via OEP (perf1=0.1) | PARTIAL | historical_rules | Same as R61 — row-level comparison; specific_rule_assertions DISABLED | Row-level perf1_percent comparison would catch if dashboard values are correct.
